# Variables

This chapter covers variables in a little more depth than the Quickstart
chapter. Some information will be repeated here so that this chapter can serve
as a better reference.

A variable acts like a container for data. It has a **type**, and a value is
**assigned** to (or stored in) the variable. You can change the value assigned
to a variable (called reassignment), but the variable's type is set when it is
created and can never be changed. Only values of the appropriate type can be
assigned to a variable.
