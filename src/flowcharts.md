# Flowcharts

The flowcharts in this book will follow a similar style to those shown in the
[flowcharts section](
https://eng.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Computer_Science/Programming_and_Computation_Fundamentals/Programming_Fundamentals_(Busbee_and_Braunschweig)/01%3A_Introduction_to_Programming/1.05%3A_Flowcharts)
of the [Programming Fundamentals textbook (by Busbee and Braunschweig)](
https://eng.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Computer_Science/Programming_and_Computation_Fundamentals/Programming_Fundamentals_(Busbee_and_Braunschweig))
, which is available for free from [libretexts.org](https://libretexts.org/).
I'll include examples as each symbol is introduced in this chapter, but I still
recommend reading the flowcharts section of the book linked above.

## Software

If you want to edit flowcharts collaboratively or want a convenient web app to
work with, then I recommend [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/). There
are also free programs that specialize in editing flowcharts and other diagrams.
The examples you see in my notes were made using [Dia](
https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/dia).
