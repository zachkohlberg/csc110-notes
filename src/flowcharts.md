# Flowcharts

This section is under construction. For now, please view the [Simple Flowcharting
Symbols](https://eng.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Computer_Science/Programming_and_Computation_Fundamentals/Programming_Fundamentals_(Busbee_and_Braunschweig)/01%3A_Introduction_to_Programming/1.05%3A_Flowcharts)
section of the free online textbook. Examples in class and in these notes will
use the same style as this textbook, and we won't be using any of the advanced
symbols for now.
