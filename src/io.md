# I/O

This chapter covers input and output (I/O) in more detail than the quickstart
chapter. It will skip the simplified I/O scripts we use in jshell to get
started, but other information will be repeated as appropriate to make this a
more useful reference.

## Terms

**Input** refers to information fed into a system. This includes text you type
into a messaging app, button presses on a game controller, and tapping on the
screen of a smartphone.

**Output** refers to information produced by a system. This includes text and
images displayed on your monitor, a file saved to your hard drive, and sounds
played through earbuds or speakers.

## I/O Devices

There are many physical I/O devices that can be used with a computer. Below are
a few examples.

Input Devices:
- Keyboard
- Mouse
- Touchscreen
- Gamepad
- Camera
- Microphone
- Scanner

Output Devices:
- Monitor
- Speaker
- Headphones/earbuds
- Printer
- Gamepad (some have speakers, vibration, and lights)

## Program I/O

This chapter focuses primarily on program I/O: information provided to and
produced by the programs we write. There are many forms of I/O used by programs;
here are a few examples:
- **Standard I/O**: standard I/O refers to input received through the user
typing on a terminal and output produced by printing to the terminal.
- **Input Devices**: programs can respond to input from devices such as
keyboards, mice, and gamepads.
- **Graphics**: programs can draw shapes, text, and images in windows and
display these on the monitor or other display devices.
- **Files**: programs can get input by reading files on storage devices such as
hard drives, solid-state drives, usb flash drives, and DVDs, and they can
produce output by writing to files on these devices.
- **The Internet**: programs can use the internet to send information to and
receive information from other computers.

The quickstart section covers some simplified functions for standard I/O. This
chapter will cover functions and classes typically used to interact with
standard I/O. Later we'll return to this chapter to learn about file I/O.
