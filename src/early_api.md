# Early Java API

The acronym "API" stands for Application Programming Interface. It refers to the
public-facing part of a program or code library that other code can interact
with. For example, the Java language has a large standard library with a
well-documented API that you'll use more as you learn the language. This chapter
will introduce a few parts of Java's API that will be useful in some of the
programs you are currently writing or will write in the near future.
