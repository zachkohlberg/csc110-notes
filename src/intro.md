# Introduction

This is a collection of notes for students taking CSC110: Programming and
Problem Solving. Along with the videos, these notes introduce most of the
topics you'll be learning about in CSC110 and can serve as a reference when you
want to revisit an older topic. This is *not* a textbook and will not cover the
material as thoroughly as a textbook would. The syllabus recommends a free
textbook if you would like to read a more detailed explanation of a topic we
present here.
