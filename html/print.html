<p>This is a collection of notes for students taking CSC110: Programming and
Problem Solving. Along with the videos, these notes introduce most of the
topics you'll be learning about in CSC110 and can serve as a reference when you
want to revisit an older topic. This is <em>not</em> a textbook and will not cover the
material as thoroughly as a textbook would. The syllabus recommends a free
textbook if you would like to read a more detailed explanation of a topic we
present here.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="software"><a class="header" href="#software">Software</a></h1>
<p>This section explains some of the software you'll be using during the semester.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="terminal"><a class="header" href="#terminal">Terminal</a></h1>
<p>A terminal is a program that allows you to type commands for your computer to
execute and view the results as text.
You can run other programs from a terminal, and it can serve the same role as
many other programs you're used to using.</p>
<h2 id="terminal-programs"><a class="header" href="#terminal-programs">Terminal Programs</a></h2>
<p>On Unix-like operating systems (such as Mac and Linux), you should be
able to find the default terminal program by searching your applications for
&quot;terminal&quot;.
This terminal is similar to what you'll see used in the videos.
Many of these terminals run a program called <code>bash</code> or <code>zsh</code> underneath, and
they should all accept the commands you see in the videos and other examples,
so Mac and Linux users don't need to set up any additional terminal software.</p>
<p>On Windows, there are two built-in terminal programs, neither of which I
recommend using:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cmd</code> is the classic Windows Command Prompt.
Most commands that work with bash/zsh will not work in the command prompt.</li>
<li><code>Powershell</code> is a more advanced terminal for Windows that supports some of
the commands you'll see used in bash terminals.
However, it will likely not be able to run the test scripts you receive with
your assignments and may not work with all of the commands you see us use.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several popular terminal emulators for Windows that emulate bash and
allow you to run the same commands as a bash terminal.
A good example is git bash, which is part of the
<a href="https://gitforwindows.org/">Git for Windows</a> project.
If you are using Windows, you should install Git for Windows or another terminal
emulator.
This will allow you to run the test scripts for assignments and use the terminal
commands you see demonstrated in class.
It also includes the program <code>git</code>, which is used in some later CSC/SER classes.</p>
<h2 id="terminal-videos"><a class="header" href="#terminal-videos">Terminal Videos</a></h2>
<p>Mark Lewis, the author of a textbook previously used for this class, has a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-wKBH-gUeo&amp;list=PLLMXbkbDbVt9z5dcm7uRgG3Fhw3u9LKoF">playlist</a>
of videos covering how to use a terminal on YouTube.
Watch these videos for a brief demonstration of the different terminal commands,
and refer to the cheatsheet below if you would like a summary of useful
commands.</p>
<h2 id="terminal-cheatsheet"><a class="header" href="#terminal-cheatsheet">Terminal Cheatsheet</a></h2>
<p>Important terms/concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>directory</strong> is a folder on your computer.</li>
<li>A <strong>path</strong> is the location of a file or directory. It is a series of
directory names separated by forward slashes on Unix-like systems or
backslashes on Windows. Examples:
<ul>
<li><code>/home/zach/Documents/Syllabus.pdf</code> is the location of a file named
&quot;Syllabus.pdf&quot;. It is in a folder named &quot;Documents&quot;, which is in a folder
named &quot;zach&quot;, which is in a folder named &quot;home&quot;, which is at the root of
the filesystem (indicated by the leading &quot;/&quot;).</li>
<li><code>C:\Users\Zach\Documents\Syllabus.pdf</code> is the equivalent path on Windows.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A <strong>relative path</strong> only tells you how to get to a file or directory from
your current location. For example, if we were in the folder <code>/home/zach</code>, then
the relative path to &quot;Syllabus.pdf&quot; in the previous example would be
<code>Documents/Syllabus.pdf</code> or <code>./Documents/Syllabus.pdf</code>. A <code>./</code> at the start of
a path refers to your current location, so a path beginning with <code>./</code> is always
relative.</li>
<li>Many commands will include placeholder text written in all caps. That part
is not meant to be copied literally when you run the command. For example, you
would type <code>cd Documents</code> to move to the &quot;Documents&quot; folder rather than
literally typing <code>cd PATH</code>.</li>
<li>Some commands have flags or optional arguments, which are normally written as
one or two hyphens followed by a word or letter.
These allow you to enable certain settings when running a command or include
additional optional information.
Some examples are the <code>-a</code> in <code>ls -a</code> or the <code>--version</code> in <code>java --version</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Navigation:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pwd</code>: &quot;<strong>p</strong>rint <strong>w</strong>orking <strong>d</strong>irectory&quot;, tells you which folder you're in</li>
<li><code>cd PATH</code>: &quot;<strong>c</strong>hange <strong>d</strong>irectory&quot;, moves you from your current
location to the directory at <code>PATH</code>
<ul>
<li><code>cd</code> on its own or <code>cd ~</code> will move you to your home directory</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>ls</code>: &quot;<strong>l</strong>i<strong>s</strong>t&quot;, lists everything in the current directory
<ul>
<li><code>ls PATH</code>: lists the contents of the directory at <code>PATH</code></li>
<li><code>ls -a</code>: includes hidden items in the output</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Viewing Files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cat PATH</code>: show the contents of the file at <code>PATH</code></li>
<li><code>less PATH</code>: view the contents of the file at <code>PATH</code>, but with more features.
Press <code>q</code> to exit <code>less</code> and return to the terminal's command prompt.</li>
</ul>
<p>Manipulating Directories:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>mkdir PATH</code>: creates an empty directory at <code>PATH</code></li>
<li><code>rmdir PATH</code>: deletes the directory at <code>PATH</code>, but only if it is empty</li>
</ul>
<p>Manipulating Files (these are dangerous and can permanently delete files, so
use with care!):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rm PATH</code>: delete the file at <code>PATH</code>. It's permanently gone, not moved to the
trash or recycle bin.</li>
<li><code>mv PATH DESTINATION</code>: move the file or directory at <code>PATH</code> to <code>DESTINATION</code>.
This can also be used to rename a file or directory.
If you move a file to another file with the same name, you will replace the file
that was already there, permanently deleting the old file.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="text-editor"><a class="header" href="#text-editor">Text Editor</a></h1>
<h2 id="what-is-a-text-editor"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-text-editor">What is a Text Editor?</a></h2>
<p>Code is written in text files.
The file will usually have an extension to indicate what language it's written
in (such as <code>.jsh</code> for jshell scripts and <code>.java</code> for Java source code), but
it's fundamentally the same as a .txt file.
A text file contains text with no formatting.
You cannot make some text bold, change its color, align it to the right
margin, etc.
A text editor can display formatted and colored text, but none of this
formatting is part of the text file.</p>
<p>Text files are different from .rtf (rich text files), .doc/.docx (Word
Documents), PDF files, and Google Doc files.
Those filetypes all contain formatting in addition to the text, and programs
like Microsoft Word and Google Docs <strong>should never be used to write code</strong>.</p>
<p>To write code, you need a text editor.
Most operating systems include a basic editor with very few features (such as
notepad on Windows), but there are much more powerful editors developed
specifically for writing code.
These editors include many features that make writing code faster and easier
than it would be in a program like notepad.</p>
<h2 id="recommended-text-editor-vs-code"><a class="header" href="#recommended-text-editor-vs-code">Recommended Text Editor: VS Code</a></h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a></strong> is a relatively new and very
popular editor developed by Microsoft.
It is widely used by software developers, includes many useful modern features,
and can be customized with numerous plugins.
I recommend using it unless you have a good reason to go with another editor.</p>
<h2 id="zachs-editor-neovim"><a class="header" href="#zachs-editor-neovim">Zach's Editor: Neovim</a></h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a></strong> is a highly customizable text editor with a
difficult learning curve, and I do not recommend using it for this class.
I mention it only because it's the editor I use, so you'll be seeing it a lot if
you're in my class or watching any of my videos.
If you like the idea of an editor that requires a lot of effort to learn, but
will pay off that effort by letting you edit text very quickly and without using
a mouse, then it might be worth trying neovim (or regular vim, or Emacs).
However, I don't expect most students to find learning one of these editors to
be worth the effort right now, and that's why I recommend VS Code.</p>
<h2 id="learning-resources"><a class="header" href="#learning-resources">Learning Resources</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Official VS Code tutorial: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-s71n0dHUk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-s71n0dHUk</a></li>

</ul>
<p>A final piece of advice: find an editor that you like and learn to use it well.
You'll have a much better time coding if you can take advantage of many of the
features your preferred editor has to offer than if you switch constantly and
never learn much about any one editor.</p>

<p>This section introduces several fundamental conceps that you'll need in order

No topic is covered fully, and we will revisit these in more detail later.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="jshell"><a class="header" href="#jshell">Jshell</a></h1>
<h2 id="introduction-1"><a class="header" href="#introduction-1">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Jshell is a REPL (<strong>R</strong>ead, <strong>E</strong>xecute, <strong>P</strong>rint, <strong>L</strong>oop). When you run a
REPL program, it does the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reads a command</li>
<li>Executes the command</li>
<li>Prints the result</li>
<li>Loops back to step 1 until told to exit</li>
</ol>
<p>For the first half of the semester, we'll be writing our programs as jshell
scripts.</p>
<p>Note: terminal emulators will show a prompt when waiting for a command. This
prompt often includes your current location and ends with the <code>$</code> character.
For clarity, the terminal's command prompt will be marked with <code>$</code>, and
jshell's prompt will be marked with <code>jshell&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>While jshell or a similar interactive program is running on your terminal,
commands will go to that program instead of the terminal. If no such program is
running, then your commands will be run by the terminal itself. This matters
because jshell commands (like <code>println</code> and <code>/exit</code>) will only work in jshell,
and terminal commands (like <code>cd</code> and <code>ls</code>) will not work in jshell.</p>
<h2 id="interactive-mode"><a class="header" href="#interactive-mode">Interactive Mode</a></h2>
<p>To open jshell on the terminal, run the <code>jshell</code> command. You should see a prompt
similar to the one below:</p>
<pre><code>$ jshell
|  Welcome to JShell -- Version 17.0.7
|  For an introduction type: /help intro

jshell&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You can now enter jshell commands and snippets of Java code. These will appear
after the <code>jshell&gt; </code> prompt. Once you've typed something, press enter to have
jshell execute it. Most jshell commands (that aren't Java code) are prefixed
with a forward slash (<code>/</code>). To exit jshell, type the command <code>/exit</code> and press
enter:</p>
<pre><code>$ jshell
|  Welcome to JShell -- Version 17.0.7
|  For an introduction type: /help intro

jshell&gt; /exit
|  Goodbye
$ 
</code></pre>
<h2 id="hello-world-interactive-mode"><a class="header" href="#hello-world-interactive-mode">Hello World: Interactive Mode</a></h2>
<p>Now we'll write some Java code. Open jshell again and enter
<code>System.out.println(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);</code> (note: most Java code will end with a
semicolon (<code>;</code>) character). Jshell should respond by repeating <code>Hello, world!</code>
on the next line:</p>
<pre><code>$ jshell
|  Welcome to JShell -- Version 17.0.7
|  For an introduction type: /help intro

jshell&gt; System.out.println(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
Hello, world!

jshell&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Try running another println instruction with a different message between the
quotes.</p>
<h2 id="hello-world-script"><a class="header" href="#hello-world-script">Hello World: Script</a></h2>
<p>Exit jshell and open your <a href="quickstart/../software/text_editor.html">text editor</a>. Open a new
file and type the following text into the file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">System.out.println(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
/exit
</code></pre>
<p>Save this file as <code>helloWorld.jsh</code> and return to the terminal.
<strong>All of your jshell scripts should end with the <code>.jsh</code> file extension</strong>.
Make sure your terminal is in the directory where you saved the file (<code>ls</code>
should show your <code>helloWorld.jsh</code> file) and run the command
<code>jshell --execution local helloWorld.jsh</code>.
You should see the <code>Hello, World!</code> message printed on the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>$ jshell --execution local helloWorld.jsh
Hello, world!
$ 
</code></pre>
<h2 id="interactive-mode-vs-script"><a class="header" href="#interactive-mode-vs-script">Interactive Mode vs Script</a></h2>
<p>Running <code>jshell</code> on its own will launch jshell as an interactive REPL.
If you want to experiment with a small amount of code and get immediate
feedback, you should run jshell in interactive mode.</p>
<p>Running <code>jshell --execution local</code> followed by the name of a jshell script (a
<code>.jsh</code> file) tells jshell to execute each line of the script in order.
This is useful if you are writing a program and don't want to retype each line
of code every time you test the program.
<strong>Remember to always end your jshell scripts with the <code>/exit</code> command</strong>, or
jshell will continue running once it reaches the end of the script.</p>
<p>When jshell runs in interactive mode, it will print additional information even
if you don't include a <code>println</code>.
For example, try typing <code>2 + 2;</code> in jshell:</p>
<pre><code>|  Welcome to JShell -- Version 17.0.7
|  For an introduction type: /help intro

jshell&gt; 2 + 2;
$1 ==&gt; 4

jshell&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>When running a script, you will only see error messages and output that you
explicitly print.
For example, write a script with the line from before (<code>2 + 2;</code>), save it as
<code>add.jsh</code>, and run it with <code>jshell add.jsh</code>.</p>
<p>The script:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">2 + 2;
/exit
</code></pre>
<p>The output from running it with jshell:</p>
<pre><code>$ jshell --execution local add.jsh
$
</code></pre>
<p>We didn't include a print command, so no output was produced. This lets us
control exactly what we want the program to show the user as it's running.</p>
<p>Finally, whenever we run a script with jshell, we need to include the
argument <code>--execution local</code> with the jshell command. This is necessary to
allow input commands (covered later) to work correctly. We only include
<code>--execution local</code> when running a script, not when using interactive mode.</p>
<p>Running a script called <code>myScriptName.jsh</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ jshell --execution local myScriptName.jsh
</code></pre>
<p>Running in interactive mode:</p>
<pre><code>$ jshell
</code></pre>
<h2 id="startup-script"><a class="header" href="#startup-script">Startup Script</a></h2>
<p>To make input and output more convenient, we're going to tell jshell to run a
few scripts on startup before it runs any of our code.
Download the <code>INPUT.jsh</code> file from Blackboard, then make sure your terminal is
in the same directory as <code>INPUT.jsh</code>.
Run jshell, then run the command <code>/set start -retain DEFAULT PRINTING INPUT.jsh</code>
in jshell. Exit jshell, start it again, and run the command <code>/list -start</code>.
The result should look similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>$ jshell
|  Welcome to JShell -- Version 17.0.7
|  For an introduction type: /help intro

jshell&gt; /set start -retain DEFAULT PRINTING INPUT.jsh

jshell&gt; /exit
|  Goodbye
$ jshell

jshell&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If you see the same list of 41 lines after running the <code>/list</code> command, then
your startup scripts should be set correctly.
The <code>DEFAULT</code> script contains the imports on the first 10 lines, and it was
already running every time you started jshell.
Those imports make it easier to access some useful code included with Java,
which is part of the <strong>Java Standard Library</strong>.
The <code>PRINTING</code> script is lines 11 to 31, and it lets us run any of the output
functions (such as <code>println</code>) without typing <code>System.out</code>.
The <code>INPUT.jsh</code> script includes the last 10 lines, and it sets up some input
functions to make it easier for us to read user input.
We'll make use of these functions soon.</p>
<p>You don't need to understand any of the code in the startup scripts right now.
We're using them specifically so you <em>don't</em> have to think about that stuff until
you learn what it all means.
Try using <code>println</code> to print a message, as shown below, to further verify that
the startup scripts were loaded correctly:</p>
<pre><code>jshell&gt; println(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>If you run into issues with the startup scripts, you can always reset them with
the command <code>/set start -retain DEFAULT</code>, and then repeat the previous
directions to add the <code>PRINTING</code> and <code>INPUT.jsh</code> scripts.</p>
<h2 id="semicolons"><a class="header" href="#semicolons">Semicolons</a></h2>
<p>Jshell considers semicolons optional some of the time. I've chosen to include
them in all of my code examples, and I recommend you use them in your code as
well for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>When we introduce code blocks, jshell will require semicolons</li>
<li>When we transition to compiled Java, semicolons will be required for your code
to compile and run</li>
</ul>
<p>I think you'll have an easier time dealing with semicolons if you're in the
habit of using them from the start. If you leave them off your code now, you'll
have more trouble in a few weeks when you need to start using them with if
statement code blocks.</p>
<h2 id="summary"><a class="header" href="#summary">Summary</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Use the <code>jshell</code> command to run in interactive mode</li>
<li>You can write jshell scripts in your text editor and save them as <code>.jsh</code>
files</li>
<li>Use the <code>jshell --execution local</code> command followed by a script name to run
a jshell script</li>
<li>Make sure you set the startup scripts as explained above and confirm that
they're working</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="output"><a class="header" href="#output">Output</a></h1>
<p>A program's output is the information it sends to some external location, such
as the terminal, the screen, a speaker, a file, or a web server.
For now, our only method of producing output will be printing text to the
terminal.</p>
<h2 id="print-functions"><a class="header" href="#print-functions">Print Functions</a></h2>
<p>We will primarily use the <code>println</code> function, which you saw in the previous
section.
There is a similar function called <code>print</code>, which is slightly different.
To illustrate the difference, here are two jshell scripts, <code>abcPrintln.jsh</code> and
<code>abcPrint.jsh</code>, along with their output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">println(&quot;A&quot;);
println(&quot;B&quot;);
println(&quot;C&quot;);
/exit
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-java">print(&quot;A&quot;);
print(&quot;B&quot;);
print(&quot;C&quot;);
/exit
</code></pre>
<pre><code>$ jshell --execution local abcPrintln.jsh
A
B
C
$ jshell --execution local abcPrint.jsh
ABC$
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the <code>println</code> function moves to the next line after printing.
This is because it adds a <strong>line break</strong> to the end of whatever text it prints.
The <code>print</code> function does not, which even leads to the terminal prompt (<code>$</code>)
being on the same line as the second program's output!</p>
<p>Usually you'll want to use <code>println</code>, but <code>print</code> can be helpful if you want to
create a line of output into multiple print statements.</p>
<h2 id="escape-sequences"><a class="header" href="#escape-sequences">Escape Sequences</a></h2>
<p>If you've experimented with printing, then you may have noticed that you cannot
print a double-quote (<code>&quot;</code>).
This is because double-quotes are used to mark the beginning and end of a
string of text.
You <em>can</em> print <code>&quot;</code> and a number of other special characters using escape
sequences.
These are typically a backslash (<code>\</code>) followed by the character or a
letter standing in for the special symbol you want to include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>\&quot;</code> is printed as <code>&quot;</code></li>
<li><code>\\</code> is printed as <code>\</code></li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="variables"><a class="header" href="#variables">Variables</a></h1>
<p>Sometimes we want our program to remember information and reuse the information
later.
We tell our program to remember something by creating a variable and
<strong>assigning</strong> the information to that variable.</p>
<h2 id="the-var-keyword"><a class="header" href="#the-var-keyword">The <code>var</code> Keyword</a></h2>
<p>We can use the <code>var</code> keyword followed by a name and initial value to create a
new variable.
This follows the format: <code>var VARIABLE_NAME = INITIAL_VALUE;</code>.
For example, <code>var x = 5;</code> will create a variable named <code>x</code> with an initial value
of the number <code>5</code>.
<code>var message = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;;</code> will create a variable named <code>message</code> with an
initial value of the text <code>Hello, World!</code>.
You can create many types of variables, but for now we'll stick with numbers
and text.</p>
<h2 id="the-assignment-operator"><a class="header" href="#the-assignment-operator">The Assignment Operator</a></h2>
<p>The equals sign (<code>=</code>) can be confusing to new programmers.
You've likely seen it used in math to establish a relationship between two
expressions.
For example, we might say &quot;x = y + z&quot; to establish that the variable x is the
sum of the variables y and z.
We might also make simpler statements, such as &quot;x = 5&quot;.
However, if we follow &quot;x = 5&quot; with the statement &quot;x = 6&quot;, then we've created a
contradiction because the variable x cannot equal 5 and 6 at the same time.</p>
<p>In programming, the equals sign means something different.
If our code says <code>x = 5;</code>, we are not stating a fact about <code>x</code> as we would be in
mathematics.
What we're really doing is telling the computer to change the value associated
with the variable <code>x</code> to the number 5.
This is called an <strong>assignment</strong>, and the equals sign is the <strong>assignment
operator</strong>.
An assignment follows the pattern <code>VARIABLE_NAME = EXPRESSION;</code>.
In our <code>x = 5;</code> example, <code>x</code> is the variable name and <code>5</code> is the <strong>expression</strong>.
An expression can be a lone number or a single variable name, but it could also
be a more complex calculation involving multiple numbers and variables.
Expressions are also not restricted to numbers.
<code>&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</code> is also an expression.</p>
<p>What does this mean? While the statement <code>x = 5;</code> followed by <code>x = 6;</code> would
normally be a contradiction in mathematics, in programming these statements
mean &quot;set the value of <code>x</code> to <code>5</code>&quot; and &quot;set the value of <code>x</code> to <code>6</code>&quot;.
They are instructions for the computer to change the value of <code>x</code> rather than
declarations about the value of <code>x</code>.
If our program follows both of these instructions, the result will be that our
variable named <code>x</code> stores the number <code>6</code>.</p>
<h2 id="outputting-variables"><a class="header" href="#outputting-variables">Outputting Variables</a></h2>
<p>You can a variable with <code>println</code> to output the information stored in the
variable.
Copy the following code into a jshell script named <code>variableOutput.jsh</code> and run
it with jshell:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">var x = 5;
print(&quot;x is equal to &quot;);
println(x);
x = 3 * x;
print(&quot;x is now equal to &quot;);
println(x);
/exit
</code></pre>
<p>A couple of notes about the above program:</p>
<ul>
<li>The variable <code>x</code> can be used in an assignment statement's expression to
calculate a new value for itself. The calculation uses the old value of <code>x</code>,
and the result of this calculation becomes the new value of <code>x</code>.</li>
<li>We only use the <code>var</code> keyword when we first create the variable. After it
exists we only refer to it by its name, even if we assign a new value to it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="names"><a class="header" href="#names">Names</a></h2>
<p>Variable names must consist of letters, numbers, and the underscore (<code>_</code>)
character, and they cannot start with a number. Among other things, this means
they <strong>cannot include spaces</strong>. Java also has certain [reserved words]
(https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/_keywords.html)
that cannot be used as variable names.</p>
<h2 id="types"><a class="header" href="#types">Types</a></h2>
<p>We'll learn more about types later. For now, keep in mind that a variable's
type is set with its initial value and cannot be changed. If you make a
variable that stores text, you cannot reassign it to hold a number. Try running
the following code in jshell and you'll see an error message:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">var x = &quot;hello&quot;;
x = 5;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="good-variable-names"><a class="header" href="#good-variable-names">Good Variable Names</a></h2>
<p>Variable names in Java <em>should</em> follow the &quot;camelCase&quot; naming convention. The
name should start with a lowercase letter, and the first letter of each word
after the first should be capitalized. All other letters are lowercase, and we
usually don't use underscores.</p>
<p>Variable names <em>should also</em> be descriptive. If you make a variable to store
somebody's age, then the name <code>age</code> describes what is in the variable and makes
our code easier to understand. Don't name your variables arbitrary letters like
<code>a</code> or <code>x</code> unless those names make sense in context. For example, <code>x</code> would be
an appropriate name for an x-coordinate on a graph, and a single arbitrary
letter is fine if the information in the variable is only a number with no
further meaning in the context of the program.</p>
<p>Your program can still work if you do not follow these rules, but your code
will be harder for a human to read. A human has to understand the code in order
to use and maintain it, so writing readable code is very important.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="input"><a class="header" href="#input">Input</a></h1>
<p>Now we'll look at how to read user input in your program. As you'll see
shortly, it's important to know how to use variables before we read user input.
The code in this section will not work if you haven't set up <code>INPUT.jsh</code>
correctly, so make sure you do that before continuing. The scripts in this
section will also fail if you try to run them without setting
<code>--execution local</code> as part of the jshell command (but remember this only
applies when running scripts, not when running jshell interactively).</p>
<h2 id="reading-text"><a class="header" href="#reading-text">Reading Text</a></h2>
<p>You can read a line of text with the <code>nextLine()</code> function. If you try this in
jshell, you should see the following:</p>
<pre><code>jshell&gt; nextLine();

</code></pre>
<p>Jshell will continue waiting until you type something and press enter, so
go ahead and type some text:</p>
<pre><code>jshell&gt; nextLine();
Hello, Jshell!
$1 ==&gt; &quot;Hello, Jshell!&quot;

jshell&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>We can see that jshell saw what we typed, but if we want to use it in our code
we need to assign the result to a variable. All of the input functions can be
used in expressions, so you can assign input to a variable like this:</p>
<pre><code>jshell&gt; var input = nextLine();
Hello again, Jshell!

jshell&gt; println(input);
Hello again, Jshell!

jshell&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="other-input-functions"><a class="header" href="#other-input-functions">Other Input Functions</a></h2>
<p>There are many other input functions, but those most likely to be useful to you
right now are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>next()</code>: reads a single word instead of an entire line</li>
<li><code>nextInt()</code>: reads an integer</li>
<li><code>nextDouble()</code>: reads a real number</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="nextline-issue"><a class="header" href="#nextline-issue"><code>nextLine()</code> Issue</a></h2>
<p>The <code>nextLine()</code> function may not behave as you expect if you use it after one
of the other input functions. Here's an example program you can try running:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">var number1 = nextInt();
var number2 = nextInt();
var text = nextLine();
println(number1);
println(number2);
println(text);
</code></pre>
<p>This program should read two integers and a line of text, then print everything
it read.
However, when running the program you'll notice that it immediately prints the
numbers and a blank line after we enter the second number.
It doesn't give us a chance to type the line of text.</p>
<p>This is the result of how the input functions process input, not a bug.
To understand why it happens, let's pretend all the user's input is in a single
text file instead of being typed as the program runs.
Here's an example of what we might type as input:</p>
<pre><code>100
200
line of text
</code></pre>
<p>We'll also include a cursor to mark our position in this text as we process it
with input functions. The cursor will be marked with the pipe (<code>|</code>) character:</p>
<pre><code>|100
200
line of text
</code></pre>
<p>When we use the <code>nextInt()</code> function (or any input function that doesn't read an
entire line of text), it will move the cursor to the end of the input that it
read.
If it doesn't find anything on the current line, then it will move to the next
line and keep looking.
Here is the cursor after the first <code>nextInt()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>100|
200
line of text
</code></pre>
<p>And here is the cursor after the second <code>nextInt()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>100
200|
line of text
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>nextLine()</code> function is a bit different. It moves to the end of the current
line and reads everything it moved past, then skips the cursor to the start of
the next line. After the <code>nextLine()</code>, we end up with this:</p>
<pre><code>100
200
|line of text
</code></pre>
<p>Did you notice that the cursor hasn't moved through any new text?
It was already at the end of the &quot;200&quot; line, so it jumped to the beginning
of the third line and read nothing.</p>
<p>So how do we deal with this?</p>
<ul>
<li>This will only happen if you use <code>nextLine()</code> <em>after a different input
function</em>, so it won't come up very often.</li>
<li>If you need to use <code>nextLine()</code> after a different input function, run the
<code>nextLine()</code> function once to move the cursor to the start of a fresh line of
input, then run it again to get your input.
A modified version of our program would look like this:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-java">var number1 = nextInt();
var number2 = nextInt();
nextLine();
var text = nextLine();
println(number1);
println(number2);
println(text);
</code></pre>
<p>This program will work as intended and read/print all three inputs from the user.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="data-types"><a class="header" href="#data-types">Data Types</a></h1>
<p>So far we've simplified the different types of information you can put in a
variable. Now we'll go over some of Java's basic types in more detail.</p>
<p>We won't go into detail about binary right now, but it's worth mentioning that
every piece of information in your computer is represented as a series of ones
and zeroes, called bits (binary digits).
These bits form a <strong>binary number</strong>.
Even though everything is a binary number when you look at the computer's
memory, different types specify different rules for interpreting these binary
numbers.
These rules let us decode binary into text, integers, real numbers, and more
complex forms of data.</p>
<p>Most of the types we cover in this section have a limited size, and they always
use the exact same number of bits no matter what value they represent.
Rather than bits, we measure the space taken up by data in bytes, which are
chunks of 8 bits.</p>
<h2 id="numbers"><a class="header" href="#numbers">Numbers</a></h2>
<p>There are two categories of numbers: integers and floating-point numbers.
Integers can only represent zero and positive or negative whole numbers.
Floating-point numbers can represent real numbers (fractions, irrational
numbers like pi, and other numbers that require a decimal), as well as
zero and whole numbers.</p>
<p>The integer types are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>byte</code>: 1-byte (8-bit) integer value; stores any integer from -128 to 127</li>
<li><code>short</code>: 2-byte (16-bit) integer value; stores any integer from -32768 to 32767</li>
<li><code>int</code>: 4-byte (32-bit) integer value and the default type for integers in Java;
stores any integer from about -2 billion to about 2 billion</li>
<li><code>long</code>: 8-byte (64-bit) integer value; stores any integer from about -9
quintilion to about 9 quintillion</li>
</ul>
<p>The floating-point types are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>float</code>: 4-byte (32-bit) floating-point value; stores numbers from about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation#E_notation">-3E38</a> to about
3E38</li>
<li><code>double</code>: 8-byte (64-bit) floating-point value and the default type for
floating-point numbers in Java; stores numbers from about -1.7E308 to about
1.7E308</li>
</ul>
<p>The differences in ranges may be surprising, and there is a significant
drawback to floating-point numbers, but we'll cover that later when we take a
closer look at binary and how numbers are represented in memory.</p>
<p>You can perform basic arithmetic with integers and floating-point numbers.
If you use numbers of different types, then they will be converted to the type
that can represent a greater range of numbers.
The symbols to use for arithmetic are <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code> (multiplication for), and
<code>/</code> (for division).</p>
<h2 id="text"><a class="header" href="#text">Text</a></h2>
<p>There are two types commonly used for representing text:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>char</code>: a single character encoded as a 2-byte integer</li>
<li><code>String</code>: a sequence of characters; the size of a <code>String</code> depends on the
number of characters in the <code>String</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The text we've been putting in quotations are <code>String</code> values. If we want
a <code>char</code>, we need to use single quotes (<code>'</code>) instead. For example, <code>&quot;A&quot;</code> is a
<code>String</code> and <code>'A'</code> is a <code>char</code>.</p>
<p>We can combine strings with other values using <strong>concatenation</strong>.
This uses the <code>+</code> symbol, and at least one of the values must be a <code>String</code>.
If one of the values is not a <code>String</code>, it will be converted to one, and then
the second value will be appended to the first value.
For example, <code>&quot;10&quot; + 5</code> is equal to <code>&quot;105&quot;</code> because the <code>5</code> is converted to a
<code>String</code> and appended to the <code>&quot;10&quot;</code>.
<code>10 + 5</code> without any quotes will perform regular addition and give us <code>15</code>.</p>
<p>If you try to add a <code>char</code> and a number, the <code>char</code> will be converted to its
numeric representation and treated as an <code>int</code> value, then regular addition
will be performed.
For example, <code>'a' + 5</code> is <code>102</code> because the character <code>'a'</code> is internally
represented by the number 97 (look up an ASCII table if you're curious about
why).
This may seem counter-intuitive, but as we'll see later it can actually be
quite useful.
If we use a <code>String</code> instead of a <code>char</code>, we'll go back to concatenation:
<code>&quot;a&quot; + 5</code> is <code>&quot;a5&quot;</code>.</p>
<h2 id="booleans"><a class="header" href="#booleans">Booleans</a></h2>
<p>We likely won't use booleans for a while, but they're briefly explained here
for the sake of completeness.
A <code>boolean</code> value is either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.
<code>boolean</code>s are used in <strong>Boolean Logic</strong>, which allows our programs to make
decisions based on input instead of always doing the same thing.
We'll talk more about the <code>boolean</code> type when we introduce if statements.</p>
<h2 id="explicit-and-inferred-types"><a class="header" href="#explicit-and-inferred-types">Explicit and Inferred Types</a></h2>
<p>The <code>var</code> keyword has Java infer the type of a variable based on the initial
value.
If we assign an initial value of <code>5</code>, for example, then it will infer
that the type is <code>int</code>.
However, it is standard practice in Java to specify the type of a variable
rather than using the <code>var</code> keyword in most situations.
Instead of <code>var x = 5;</code>, we would write <code>int x = 5;</code>, putting the type before the
variable name instead of <code>var</code>.
This makes it easier to specify types other than the default <code>int</code> and <code>double</code>
for numbers, and it makes it easier to tell what type a variable is when looking
at the code.
From now on, most examples will use explicit types rather than inferred types.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="functions"><a class="header" href="#functions">Functions</a></h1>
<p>A function is a series of instructions (lines of code) that can be <strong>called</strong>
from another part of the program.
We'll learn more about functions and how to write our own functions later, but
for now we'll only look at how to call them.
We've already used several functions in our code, such as <code>println</code> and
<code>nextLine</code>.</p>
<h2 id="function-call-syntax"><a class="header" href="#function-call-syntax">Function Call Syntax</a></h2>
<p>A <strong>function call</strong> in Java follows the format <code>FUNCTION_NAME(ARGUMENTS)</code>.
Function names follow the same rules as variable names, and like variables they
<em>should</em> use camelCase and be descriptive.</p>
<p>Some functions require <strong>arguments</strong>, much like programs on the terminal.
An argument is addtional information that the function must have in order to
work, and the arguments for a function call always appear in a comma-separated
list between parenthesis (<code>(</code> and <code>)</code>) after the function's name.
Sometimes these arguments are optional (technically there are two functions with
the same name, one that requires arguments and one that doesn't), but the
parenthesis are always required, even if the function never has arguments.
An example would be the <code>println</code> function, which can be called with no
arguments (<code>println()</code> only prints a blank line), but it otherwise needs an
argument to tell it what text to print (<code>println(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);</code> prints the
message <code>Hello, World!</code>).</p>
<h2 id="return-value"><a class="header" href="#return-value">Return Value</a></h2>
<p>Some function calls <strong>return</strong> information after they finish, and this
information can be used an part of an expression.
All of the input functions return the information they read from the terminal.
If you call a function that returns something, you should almost always use
the result for something or store it in a variable for later.
Calling <code>readInt</code> on its own isn't very useful because the integer isn't saved
anywhere.
Calling <code>readInt</code> <strong>and</strong> assigning the result to a variable
(<code>int x = readInt();</code>) lets you use the number you read in other parts of your
code.</p>
<h2 id="methods"><a class="header" href="#methods">Methods</a></h2>
<p>You may see the term &quot;method&quot; used to refer to functions. A <strong>method</strong> is a
concept from object-oriented programming, and it refers to a function attached
to an <strong>object</strong>.
Technically, most functions in Java are methods, including all of the functions
we've used so far.
For now, I'll use the term function for anything that is presented to you as a
standalone function.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="comments"><a class="header" href="#comments">Comments</a></h1>
<p>A comment is text that is ignored when compiling or running a program. Comments
can be used for many purposes, and the way you use comments will evolve as you
learn more about programming.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-comments"><a class="header" href="#types-of-comments">Types of Comments</a></h2>
<p>A single-line comment is created with two forward-slashes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">// this text is a comment and will be ignored when the program runs
</code></pre>
<p>Everything after the slashes is ignored. You can put a comment on the same line
as code, but I find it's easier to read code when comments are on separate
lines:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">// a comment on the same line as the code:

int x = 5; // this makes a variable named x with an initial value of 5

// a comment on its own line (usually my preference):

// this makes a variable named y with an initial value of 7
int y = 7;
</code></pre>
<p>You can create a comment that spans multiple lines (a block comment) using <code>/*</code>
to mark the beginning of the block and <code>*/</code> to mark the end of the block:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">/*
All of the text in this example is inside of a block comment.

Nothing I write here will be treated as code if you were to run this in jshell.

If this were a real program, it would be pointless :(
*/
</code></pre>
<h2 id="how-to-use-comments"><a class="header" href="#how-to-use-comments">How to Use Comments</a></h2>
<p>Comments can serve many purposes, and how you use them depends on many things,
such as who you're working with, the project you're working on, and the language
you're coding in. For a beginner programmer, I would recommend using comments
for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking notes inside your code to explain what the code is doing</li>
<li>Temporarily disabling (&quot;commenting out&quot;) code without deleting it (put <code>//</code> at
the start of a line of code and it will be ignored when you run the program).
This is helpful if you are trying to fix a problem and want to disable a line of
code that causes an error or see what happens when that line is skipped.</li>
<li>Documenting important information about your program, such as the author(s),
the program's purpose, citations if appropriate</li>
<li>Outlining part of a program before you write it</li>
<li>Leaving &quot;todo&quot; comments, or reminders about tasks you plan to finish later</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these will not always be relevant to you. For example, it's usually not
helpful to put comments throughout your program explaining every line of code
once you get the hang of programming.
You and the other experienced programmers will generally assume that the people
working on a project understand code and don't need every line explained.
However, these types of comments can be useful if you're learning a new
language, and they're good to include in code samples that are meant to teach
a new concept to someone.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="variables-1"><a class="header" href="#variables-1">Variables</a></h1>
<p>This chapter covers variables in a little more depth than the Quickstart
chapter. Some information will be repeated here so that this chapter can serve
as a better reference.</p>
<p>A variable acts like a container for data. It has a <strong>type</strong>, and a value is
<strong>assigned</strong> to (or stored in) the variable. You can change the value assigned
to a variable (called reassignment), but the variable's type is set when it is
created and can never be changed. Only values of the appropriate type can be
assigned to a variable.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="creating-variables"><a class="header" href="#creating-variables">Creating Variables</a></h1>
<p>There are a few terms that are helpful to cover. The <a href="variables/../templates.html#declare-and-initialize-a-variable">templates chapter</a> has some examples to
illustrate declaring, initializing, and reassigning variables.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type</strong>: a variable's type tells us what kind of information it contains. A
computer stores everything as a series of 0's and 1's (bits), and the type tells
it how to interpret those bits. Two identical sequences of bits can each mean
something completely different depending on their types.</li>
<li><strong>Value</strong>: a variable's value is the information stored in it.</li>
<li><strong>Declare</strong>: creating a new variable is called declaring a variable, and we
might refer to a line of code that declares a variable as a &quot;variable
declaration&quot;. This is also when the variable's type is set.</li>
<li><strong>Initialize</strong>: when we set a variable's initial value, this is called
&quot;initialization,&quot; or initializing the variable. This usually happens in the same
line of code that declares the variable, but we are allowed to declare a
variable without initializing it (this is usually a bad idea, so don't do it
unless you have a good reason).</li>
<li><strong>Identifier</strong>: the term &quot;identifier&quot; refers to the name by which we identify
a variable (as well as other constructs, such as functions and classes, which
we'll cover later). There are rules for what is and isn't a valid identifier,
and with a few exceptions we cannot use the same identifier for multiple
variables (when this <em>is</em> allowed, it's called &quot;shadowing&quot;, but you should avoid
doing this most of the time).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="variable-declaration"><a class="header" href="#variable-declaration">Variable Declaration</a></h2>
<p>There are two ways to declare a new variable: using the <code>var</code> keyword and
allowing Java to infer the type, or explicitly stating the type before the
variable's name. Here are two examples:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">var x = 5; // type is inferred to be int
int y = 5; // type is explicitly stated as int
</code></pre>
<p>In Java, we usually state the type explicitly. The <code>var</code> keyword is sometimes
used, but I recommend you stick to explicitly typed variables and avoid using
<code>var</code>. When the type appears before the name, this can make it easier for you to
determine a variable's type when reading the code.</p>
<h2 id="variable-initialization"><a class="header" href="#variable-initialization">Variable Initialization</a></h2>
<p>In the previous example, both variables were initialized at the same time they
were declared (the <code>= 5</code> sets their initial value to <code>5</code>). However, if we state
the type of a variable, we are allowed to initialize it later:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int x; // declared, but not initialized
println(&quot;We've not yet set a value for x.&quot;);
x = 5; // this is the first time we set x's value, so it's now initialized
println(&quot;Now x is initialized to &quot; + x + &quot;.&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>If you have an uninitialized variable, it is an error to try to access the data
stored inside that variable. If we try to print the value of <code>x</code> before it's
been initialized, then we'll get an error message:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int x;
println(&quot;I'd tell you that x is equal to &quot; + x + &quot;, but that's not allowed yet!&quot;);
x = 10;
println(&quot;Now we can safely print that x is equal to &quot; + x + &quot;.&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>Usually you won't have a reason to declare a variable without initilizing it.
We'll see some examples later on where it makes sense to do this, but for now
you should always initialize your variables when you declare them.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="assignment-operator"><a class="header" href="#assignment-operator">Assignment Operator</a></h1>
<p>The assignment operator (<code>=</code>) can cause some confusion. When you start writing
<a href="variables/../if/comparisons.html">comparisons</a> and using the equality operator (<code>==</code>), it's
easy to mix up what each of these mean. One of the reasons this can be confusing
is the difference between imperative programming (the style of programming that
Java primarily supports and that we will be using) treats variables differently
from mathematics.</p>
<h2 id="variables-in-math"><a class="header" href="#variables-in-math">Variables in Math</a></h2>
<p>If this were an algebra class and I gave you the following statements, you would
probably be confused:</p>
<pre><code>x = 5
x = 6
x = x + 3
</code></pre>
<p>The first two statements, <code>x = 5</code> and <code>x = 6</code> contradict one another and imply
that <code>5 = 6</code>, which we know is not true. The third statement contradicts itself,
because a number cannot equal itself plus 3 (this would imply that <code>0 = 3</code> if we
subtract an <code>x</code> from both sides). In math, we would view the above statements as
factual statements about the variable <code>x</code>, and because of the contradictions
they cannot be true statements (the first or second would be fine on their own).</p>
<h2 id="variables-in-imperative-programming"><a class="header" href="#variables-in-imperative-programming">Variables in Imperative Programming</a></h2>
<p>In Java, the previous statements are perfectly fine and do not contradict one
another. This is because the <code>=</code> sign does not have the same meaning in Java
that it has in algebra. In Java, the <code>=</code> sign is the <strong>assignment operator</strong>,
and it is instructing the computer to change the value associated with <code>x</code>.
The value of <code>x</code> is allowed to change over time, and it will be different after
each instruction that <strong>assigns</strong> a value to <code>x</code>. After the first statement,
<code>x</code> will be equal to 5. After the second, it will be equal to 6. After the
third, it will be equal to 9, because it uses the previous value (6) in the
calculation before it assigns the new value. We can see this if we add a
declaration and several print statements to the program and run it in Jshell:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int x;
x = 5;
println(&quot;x is &quot; + x);
x = 6;
println(&quot;x is &quot; + x);
x = x + 3;
println(&quot;x is &quot; + x);
</code></pre>
<p>The equality operator (<code>==</code>) has a meaning closer to how we would interpret an
equals sign in mathematics. It is stating that two values are the same, but it
is still valid to make false or contradictory statements with <code>==</code> in Java. If
we do, then the result will be <code>false</code> instead of <code>true</code>. This is because the
equality operator is asking a question rather than asserting that something must
be true, and both yes (<code>true</code>) and no (<code>false</code>) are valid answers to that
question. We can demonstrate this with the following program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int x = 10;
int y = 13;
boolean xEqualsItself = (x == x);
boolean xEqualsY = (x == y);
boolean xEqualsFive = (x == 5);
boolean xEqualsTen = (x == 10);
boolean xEqualsItselfPlus1 = (x == x + 1);
println(&quot;The value of x is &quot; + x);
println(&quot;The value of y is &quot; + y);
println(&quot;Does x equal itself? &quot; + xEqualsItself);
println(&quot;Does x equal y? &quot; + xEqualsY);
println(&quot;Does x equal five? &quot; + xEqualsFive);
println(&quot;Does x equal ten? &quot; + xEqualsTen);
println(&quot;Does x equal itself plus one? &quot; + xEqualsItselfPlus1);
</code></pre>
<p>The parenthesis around the equality checks on lines 2-5 are not necessary, but
I've included them to make it clear what the order of operations will be. First
we evaluate whether <code>x</code> is equal to the value to the right of the <code>==</code>, which
results in <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, and then we assign the result to the variable on
the left of the <code>=</code>. Try running this, and note that despite some of the answers
being false, we don't actually get an error from those false statements. Again,
this is because they are questions rather than statements of fact.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="variable-names"><a class="header" href="#variable-names">Variable Names</a></h1>
<p>Variable names, and identifiers in general, have to follow a few rules in Java.
You can find these rules at the end of <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/variables.html">this</a> page,
but we'll summarize them here:</p>
<ul>
<li>You cannot use a [Java keyword](
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/_keywords.html as an
identifier.</li>
<li>An identifier can only contain letters (uppercase or lowercase), numbers,
the underscore character (<code>_</code>), or the dollar sign (<code>$</code>) character.</li>
<li>An identifier cannot begin with a number.</li>
<li>Identifiers are case-sensitive, which means <code>thisname</code> and <code>thisName</code> are
<em>different</em> identifiers even though they look nearly the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also some optional rules that you <em>should</em> follow with identifiers.
These rules are only optional in the sense that your code can technically run if
you break these rules, but your code will be harder to read and much more likely
to contain errors if you don't follow them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Java variable names should follow the lower camel case naming convention. This
means all variable names should start with a lowercase letter, contain no
underscores or dollar signs, and each word after the first should start with an
uppercase letter. For example <code>thisVariableNameIsUsingLowerCamelCase</code>, although
in practice you don't want your variable names to be that long. This is
important because most other Java code (including the standard library code you
will be using in your own programs) is written this way, and not following this
convention will make the names in your code inconsistent and easy to mix up.</li>
<li>Don't create two identifiers that are the same except for capitalization. This
is confusing and makes it easy to accidentally use the wrong identifier.</li>
<li>Whenever possible, give your variables descriptive names. If a variable has
some inherent meaning (such as a variable that stores a person's name), then use
a name that will tell the reader what that meaning is. For example, a variable
that stores someone's age could be called <code>age</code>, and a variable that stores a
person's name could be called <code>name</code>. This makes it much easier to understand
your code.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="pen--paper-analogy"><a class="header" href="#pen--paper-analogy">Pen &amp; Paper Analogy</a></h1>
<p>Many new programmers have difficulty learning to think it terms of variables,
but this is a fundamental skill for writing code. It may be helpful to think
about variables in terms of writing information down by hand on a piece of paper
or a whiteboard. Everything we can do with a variable can be represented this
way, which lets you simulate small amounts of code by hand or think through the
process in your head to better understand what's going on.</p>
<h2 id="declare-and-initialize"><a class="header" href="#declare-and-initialize">Declare and Initialize</a></h2>
<p>If we declare a variable in a program (<code>int x</code>), this is equivalent to writing
the label <code>x</code> on our paper. When we initialize that variable in code (<code>x = 5</code>), 
we would write the initial value on the paper beneath or next to <code>x</code>.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int x;
x = 5;
int y = 10;
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>x -&gt; 5</p>
<p>y -&gt; 10</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="reassign"><a class="header" href="#reassign">Reassign</a></h2>
<p>Reassigning the variable in code (<code>x = 10</code>) is equivalent to crossing out the
old value of <code>x</code> and replacing it with the new value.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">x = 11;
y = -4;
x = 3;
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>x -&gt; <del>5</del> <del>11</del> 3</p>
<p>y -&gt; <del>10</del> -4</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="print"><a class="header" href="#print">Print</a></h2>
<p>Printing the variable (<code>println(x)</code>) means we're communicating it to someone
else. We could write it down on a separate piece of paper, or we could read the
text out loud to the other person.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">println(x);
println(y);
</code></pre>
<p>Variable record</p>
<blockquote>
<p>x -&gt; <del>5</del> <del>11</del> 3</p>
<p>y -&gt; <del>10</del> -4</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="variable-scope-and-shadowing"><a class="header" href="#variable-scope-and-shadowing">Variable Scope and Shadowing</a></h1>
<h2 id="scope"><a class="header" href="#scope">Scope</a></h2>
<p>Once we start using code blocks, we can have variables with different <strong>scopes</strong>
in our programs. A variable's scope is the portion of the program where it
exists. If we try to refer to a variable outside of its scope, we'll get an
error because it doesn't exist.</p>
<p>When you declare a variable inside of a code block, that variable's scope is
limited to the inside of that code block. Once the code block ends, the variable
no longer exists. Try running the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">if (true) {
    int text = &quot;Hello&quot;;
    println(text);
}
println(text);
</code></pre>
<p>We'll get an error when we try to print <code>text</code> a second time because it only
exists inside the code block.</p>
<h2 id="shadowing"><a class="header" href="#shadowing">Shadowing</a></h2>
<p>Shadowing occurs when we have two variables with the same name. The newer
variable &quot;shadows&quot; the older variable, taking its place until the newer
variable goes out of scope. Jshell will allow shadowing within the same scope,
which permanently replaces the old variable, but in compiled Java we can only
shadow when the new variable has a different scope from the original.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">// this will work fine in jshell, but it won't compile as part of a Java program
int x = 5;
int x = 10; // stating the type declares a new variable named x

// the correct way to change the value of a variable from 5 to 10 is to reassign
// it, not declare the variable a second time
int y = 5;
y = 10; // reassigns the variable instead of redeclaring it
</code></pre>
<p>Usually it's best to avoid this, but in my experience it's common for new
programmers to unnecessarily declare the same variable multiple times until
they learn the difference between <a href="variables/../variables/creating_variables.html">declaring and initializing</a> a variable and <a href="variables/../variables/assignment.html">reassigning</a> a variable. Jshell makes this bad habit easier to
form because it allows shadowing within the same scope, as shown above. Compiled
Java will still allow shadowing when the scopes differ:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">// shadowing
int x = 5;
if (true) {
    // this is a new variable named x, and it will cease to exist at the end of
    // this block of code
    int x = 10;
}
// this prints the original x value of 5 because we made a new temporary x
// instead of reassigning x
println(x);

// no shadowing
int y = 5;
if (true) {
    // we reassign y instead of declaring a new y with `int y = ...`
    y = 10;
}
// the original y was reassigned to 10, so this will print 10
println(y);
</code></pre>
<p>In general, I recommend that you avoid shadowing because of the errors that it
enables you to make.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="io"><a class="header" href="#io">I/O</a></h1>
<p>This chapter covers input and output (I/O) in more detail than the quickstart
chapter. It will skip the simplified I/O scripts we use in jshell to get
started, but other information will be repeated as appropriate to make this a
more useful reference.</p>
<h2 id="terms"><a class="header" href="#terms">Terms</a></h2>
<p><strong>Input</strong> refers to information fed into a system. This includes text you type
into a messaging app, button presses on a game controller, and tapping on the
screen of a smartphone.</p>
<p><strong>Output</strong> refers to information produced by a system. This includes text and
images displayed on your monitor, a file saved to your hard drive, and sounds
played through earbuds or speakers.</p>
<h2 id="io-devices"><a class="header" href="#io-devices">I/O Devices</a></h2>
<p>There are many physical I/O devices that can be used with a computer. Below are
a few examples.</p>
<p>Input Devices:</p>

<li>Keyboard</li>
<li>Mouse</li>
<li>Touchscreen</li>

<h2 id="program-io"><a class="header" href="#program-io">Program I/O</a></h2>
<p>This chapter focuses primarily on program I/O: information provided to and
produced by the programs we write. There are many forms of I/O used by programs;
here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standard I/O</strong>: standard I/O refers to input received through the user
typing on a terminal and output produced by printing to the terminal.</li>
<li><strong>Input Devices</strong>: programs can respond to input from devices such as
keyboards, mice, and gamepads.</li>
<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: programs can draw shapes, text, and images in windows and
display these on the monitor or other display devices.</li>
<li><strong>Files</strong>: programs can get input by reading files on storage devices such as
hard drives, solid-state drives, usb flash drives, and DVDs, and they can
produce output by writing to files on these devices.</li>
<li><strong>The Internet</strong>: programs can use the internet to send information to and
receive information from other computers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The quickstart section covers some simplified functions for standard I/O. This
chapter will cover functions and classes typically used to interact with
standard I/O. Later we'll return to this chapter to learn about file I/O.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="formatting-with-printf"><a class="header" href="#formatting-with-printf">Formatting with printf</a></h1>
<p>String <a href="io/../types/strings.html#concatenation">concatenation</a> works well for
combining sever string literals and variables when no additional formatting is
required, but it can be cumbersome when there are many variables and doesn't
offer any tools for controlling how values are formatted. You can write your own
code to control formatting, but this can get repetitive and tedious. The
<code>printf</code> function offers a better solution in these situations.</p>
<p>Look at the following code that prints the time for a 12-hour clock using
concatenation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">String amOrPm = nextLine();
int hour = nextInt();
int minute = nextInt();
int second = nextInt();

String minuteFormatted;
if (minute &lt; 10) {
    minuteFormatted = &quot;0&quot; + minute;
} else {
    minuteFormatted = &quot;&quot; + minute;
}
String secondFormatted;
if (second &lt; 10) {
    secondFormatted = &quot;0&quot; + second;
} else {
    secondFormatted = &quot;&quot; + second;
}

String time = hour + &quot;:&quot; + minuteFormatted + &quot;:&quot; + secondFormatted + &quot; &quot; + amOrPm;
println(time);
</code></pre>
<p>This code works, but it has the drawbacks we just mentioned: the concatenated
string expression is long and hard to read due to all of the breaks in the
string literals and <code>+</code> symbols joining the different parts, and we have to
write additional code to control how some of the numbers are formatted.</p>
<p>Compare this to using the <code>printf</code> function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">String amOrPm = nextLine();
int hour = nextInt();
int minute = nextInt();
int second = nextInt();

printf(&quot;%d:%02d:%02d %s\n&quot;, hour, minute, second, amOrPm);
</code></pre>
<p>This produces the same output, but with far less code. The downside is that we
may not know how to read the format string at the beginning. Let's fix that!</p>
<h2 id="format-strings-and-args"><a class="header" href="#format-strings-and-args">Format Strings and Args</a></h2>
<p>The <code>printf</code> function takes a format string that includes placeholder values for
any variables that we want to insert into the string. After this format string,
we include a list of arguments (the values we want to insert) in the same order
that their placeholders appear in the string.</p>
<p>It's also important to note that <code>printf</code>, unlike <code>println</code>, does not
automatically add a line break to the end of its output. If we want a line
break, and we usually do, then we need to include the <code>\n</code> <a href="io/../types/numeric/chars.html#escape-sequences">escape sequence</a> in the format string.</p>
<h2 id="formatting-specifiers"><a class="header" href="#formatting-specifiers">Formatting Specifiers</a></h2>
<p>The placeholders are &quot;formatting specifiers,&quot; and their job is to convey the
type of value to insert into the string as well as how we want to format that
value. A formatting specifier has two or three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>They begin with a percent sign <code>%</code></li>
<li>They can (but don't have to) include some formatting information in the
middle, such as the <code>02</code> in our time example</li>
<li>They end in a character that represents the type of value we're going to
insert at that point in the string, such as <code>d</code> (decimal, as in &quot;base-10&quot;,
integer) or <code>s</code> (string)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="interpreting-our-example"><a class="header" href="#interpreting-our-example">Interpreting Our Example</a></h2>
<p>With all this in mind, how do we interpret the <code>&quot;%d:%02d:%02d %s&quot;</code> from our
time example?</p>
<ul>
<li>Each <code>%d</code> represents an integer</li>
<li>A <code>%02d</code> is an integer with additional formatting: if it's shorter than <code>2</code>
characters then it should be padded with <code>0</code>s so that it takes up <code>2</code> characters
of space</li>
<li>A <code>%s</code> is a string (the &quot;AM&quot;/&quot;PM&quot; value)</li>
<li>The colons (<code>:</code>) and space are not part of any placeholder values, so they'll
be printed as they appear in the string</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's apply these rules and see what our string looks like if <code>hour</code> is <code>9</code>,
<code>minute</code> is <code>5</code>, <code>second</code> is <code>30</code>, and <code>amOrPm</code> is <code>&quot;AM&quot;</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>hour</code> is the first argument, so it takes the place of the <code>%d</code>:
<code>&quot;9:%02d:%02d %s&quot;</code></li>
<li><code>minute</code> is the second argument, so it takes the place of the first <code>%02d</code>,
and because <code>%02d</code> specifies that we pad with <code>0</code> to ensure our number is at
least <code>2</code> characters long, we change the <code>5</code> to <code>05</code>:
<code>&quot;9:05:%02d %s&quot;</code></li>
<li><code>second</code> is the third argument, so it takes the place of the second <code>%02d</code>:
<code>&quot;9:05:30 %s&quot;</code></li>
<li><code>amOrPm</code> is the last argument, so it takes the place of the <code>%s</code> at the end of
the format string: <code>&quot;9:05:30 AM&quot;</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="documentation"><a class="header" href="#documentation">Documentation</a></h2>
<p>This example showed a few of the many types and methods for formatting those
types that <code>printf</code> supports. Java has <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Formatter.html">detailed documentation</a> for
formatting strings, and there are also some <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/numberformat.html">tutorials</a>
that you may find <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/formatting.html">helpful</a>. Not all
of this documentation is going to make sense early on, but the more you use
<code>printf</code> and check the documentation, the better you'll be able to use Java's
documentation to find the information you need.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="types-1"><a class="header" href="#types-1">Types</a></h1>
<p>This chapter covers primitive numeric types and Strings. Several new terms are
used in this chapter, so here are some definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primitive Type</strong>: if we store a value of a primitive type in a variable, the
value is stored directly in the variable. Most of the types we're working with
for now are primitive types (except for <code>String</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Reference Type</strong>: reference types are stored in a different memory location
called the &quot;heap&quot;, and variables store the value's location rather than the
entire value (this is because reference types are usually large, and storing a
single copy uses much less memory than giving each variable its own copy). We
don't have to worry about this right now, but I'm mentioning it so you know the
term for types that aren't primitive.</li>
<li><strong>Literal</strong>: if we &quot;hard-code&quot; a value, writing the actual number, string, or
char in the code rather than using a variable, this is called a literal value.
For example: numbers (<code>0</code>, <code>3.14</code>, or <code>-20</code>), chars (<code>'a'</code>, or <code>'!'</code>), and
strings (<code>&quot;hello&quot;</code> or <code>&quot;this is a string&quot;</code>).</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="numeric-types"><a class="header" href="#numeric-types">Numeric Types</a></h1>
<p>Most of the types we cover in this chapter represent numbers. We'll usually use
only a few of these types, but they're all covered here so you're familiar with
the terms.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="integers"><a class="header" href="#integers">Integers</a></h1>
<p>Integer types can represent positive and negative whole numbers, as well as the
number zero. Java's integer types are <code>long</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>short</code>, and <code>byte</code>.</p>
<p><code>int</code> is Java's default integer type. Most of our integers will use the <code>int</code>
type, but <code>long</code> will be necessary if we're dealing with numbers too large to
represent with <code>int</code>.</p>
<h2 id="integer-division"><a class="header" href="#integer-division">Integer Division</a></h2>
<p>We can add, subtract, multiply, and divide integers, but division may not work
the way you expect. Dividing one integer by another always results in an
integer. If there is a remainder, the result is <strong>truncated</strong>, which means the
remainder is dropped. This causes integer division to always round towards
zero (negative numbers round up and positive numbers round down).</p>
<p>The <a href="types/numeric/./modulo.html">modulo</a> operator can be used if you would like the remainder
from dividing two integers <em>instead</em> of the quotient.</p>
<h2 id="overflow"><a class="header" href="#overflow">Overflow</a></h2>
<p>Each integer type can only represent values within <a href="types/numeric/../primitives.html">a set range</a>, and if an integer exceeds this value it will <strong>overflow</strong>.
When an integer overflows, it wraps around to the opposite end of its range of
possible values. To see this in action, try running the jshell script below.
Before you run it, write down what number you think each print statement will
output.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">byte a = 255;
byte b = -256;
byte c = 200;
int d = 2147483647;

println(a + 1);
println(a + 5);
println(b - 1);
println(b + 1);
println(c + 55);
println(c + 56);
println(c + 100);
println(d + 1);
</code></pre>
<p>We'll see exactly why this happens when we learn how binary numbers work.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="floating-point-numbers"><a class="header" href="#floating-point-numbers">Floating-Point Numbers</a></h1>
<p>Floating-point types can represent real numbers, which includes integers,
fractions, and numbers like \( \pi \) that cannot be represented as a
fraction. Java's floating-point types are <code>float</code> (single precision
floating-point number) and <code>double</code> (double-precision floating-point number).</p>
<p><code>double</code> is Java's default floating-point type, and we will not normally have a
reason to use the less precise <code>float</code> type.</p>
<h2 id="precision"><a class="header" href="#precision">Precision</a></h2>
<p>Floating-point numbers do not represent exact values. You may have noticed that
they can store a far larger range of values than integer types that use the
same amount of memory, and this is only possible because they have a limited
precision. For now, it's best to think of a floating-point number as a close
approximation or a small range of possible values rather than a precise value.</p>
<p>Due to this limited precision, you will sometimes see floating-point
calculations that result in values that are slightly off from what you would
expect if you were working with exact numbers. For example, <code>0.1 + 0.2</code> will
result in <code>0.30000000000000004</code> instead of the expected <code>0.3</code>. As you'll be
reminded in the chapters on <a href="types/numeric/../../if.html">if statements</a> and <a href="types/numeric/../../boolean.html">boolean logic</a>, this lack of precision makes it a bad idea to try checking
whether two floating-point values are exactly the same.</p>
<h2 id="overflow-1"><a class="header" href="#overflow-1">Overflow</a></h2>
<p>Floating-point numbers do not overflow like integers. If you exceed the minimum
or maximum value that a floating-point format can represent, you'll end up with
<code>Infinity</code> or <code>-Infinity</code>.</p>
<h2 id="underflow"><a class="header" href="#underflow">Underflow</a></h2>
<p>Floating-point numbers can experience underflow. This can happen if you add or
subtract a small number from a much larger number, such as subtracting <code>1</code> from
<code>1000000000000000000000.0</code>. The limited precision of floating-point numbers
means it can only represent the first 17 or so digits of the number (the
<strong>significant digits</strong>, if you're used to scientific notation), and changes to
the later digits are too small to affect these significant digits. This is why,
in Java, <code>1000000000000000000000.0 + 1.0</code> will equal <code>1000000000000000000000.0</code>.</p>
<h2 id="why"><a class="header" href="#why">Why</a></h2>
<p>Like some of the quirks of integers, for now it's most important to understand
that they exist and that they are supposed to function this way. We'll learn
more about how they work when we learn about binary numbers.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="chars"><a class="header" href="#chars">Chars</a></h1>
<p>The <code>char</code> type represents a text character, but internally it is an <strong>unsigned
integer</strong>. <a href="types/numeric/../strings.html">Strings</a> are made up of <code>char</code>s, and the fact that
a <code>char</code> is a number allows us to manipulate it in some interesting ways.</p>
<h2 id="ascii-and-numeric-representation"><a class="header" href="#ascii-and-numeric-representation">ASCII and Numeric Representation</a></h2>
<p>If you look up an <a href="https://www.asciitable.com/">ASCII table</a>, you'll see the
numeric values of some characters. If you were to convert the character <code>'a'</code>
into an <code>int</code>, for example, it would be 97. ASCII is an older format, but the
characters on that table are generally encoded as the same numbers in more
modern formats.</p>
<p>Note that the encodings for the digits 0 to 9, the lowercase letters a to z, and
the uppercase letters A to Z are sequential. <code>'a'</code> is 97, <code>'b'</code> is 98, etc. We
can use this fact to determine a letter's place in the alphabet, whether a
<code>char</code> is a letter, digit, uppercase, or lowercase, and what letters come before
or after another letter.</p>
<h2 id="escape-sequences-1"><a class="header" href="#escape-sequences-1">Escape Sequences</a></h2>
<p>Some characters have a special meaning inside <code>String</code> and <code>char</code> literals, and
some characters cannot be displayed or easily typed into a program. To include
these characters in a <code>String</code> or <code>char</code> literal, we need to escape them with a
backslash (<code>\</code>, which is usually located above the return key on a keyboard).</p>
<p>Characters with special meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>\</code> is used to escape other characters, so we need to escape it: <code>'\\'</code></li>
<li><code>'</code> is used to mark the beginning and end of a <code>char</code> literal, so it must be
escaped inside a <code>char</code> literal: <code>'\''</code></li>
<li><code>&quot;</code> is used to mark the beginning and end of a <code>String</code> literal, so it must be
escaped inside a <code>String</code> literal: <code>&quot;\&quot;&quot;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Whitespace characters that are hard to print:</p>
<ul>
<li>A linebreak is represented as <code>\n</code> inside a <code>char</code> or <code>String</code> literal</li>
<li>A tab is represented as <code>\t</code> inside a <code>char</code> or <code>String</code> literal</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="modulo"><a class="header" href="#modulo">Modulo</a></h1>
<p>The modulo operator is like a fifth arithmetic operation. You're probably used
to addition (<code>+</code>), subtraction (<code>-</code>), multiplication (<code>*</code>), and division (<code>/</code>).
Modulo is written as <code>%</code>, and it will divide its operands but give us the
remainder rather than the quotient. This is the information we normally lose
when performing <a href="types/numeric/./integers.html#integer-division">integer division</a>.</p>
<p>For example, if we calculated 100 / 40 by hand, we would end up with either
2.5, 2 and 1/2, or 2 with a remainder of 20, depending on how we wanted to
write the result. The last version, 2 with remainder 20, shows us the
information we get with integer division (2, the quotient) and modulo (20, the
remainder). <code>100 / 40</code> would result in <code>2</code>, and <code>100 % 40</code> would result in <code>20</code>.</p>
<p>Modulo has many uses. A couple that you'll encounter in this class are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Checking if one number is divisible by another number, particularly whether
numbers are divisible by 2 (even/odd)</li>
<li>Breaking a quantity in a small unit (such as cents) into one or more larger
units along with the leftover quantity in the original unit (such as converting
from cents into dollars while remembering the leftover cents: 327 cents is 3
dollars and 27 cents).</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="numeric-conversions"><a class="header" href="#numeric-conversions">Numeric Conversions</a></h1>
<p>You can convert between different numeric types. Some of these conversions must
be explicitly stated in your code, and others can be performed implicitly. In
general, conversions from a smaller type to a larger type (widening conversions)
can happen automatically because they shouldn't cause a loss of information.
Conversions from a larger type to a smaller type will result in an error unless
you explicitly tell the program to perform the conversion because these risk
losing information and causing other errors that are much more difficult to fix.</p>
<h2 id="implicit-conversions"><a class="header" href="#implicit-conversions">Implicit Conversions</a></h2>
<p>Java can implicitly convert from any type earlier in this list to a type later
in the list:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>byte</code></li>
<li><code>short</code></li>
<li><code>int</code></li>
<li><code>long</code></li>
<li><code>float</code></li>
<li><code>double</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Java will also implicitly convert from a <code>char</code> to <code>int</code> or any type below <code>int</code>
on the list, but it will not implicitly convert any type to a <code>char</code>.</p>
<p>The following code demonstrates a few implicit conversions.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">byte a = 10;
short b = a;
int c = b;
long d = c;
float e = d;
double f = e;

println(a + &quot;, &quot; + b + &quot;, &quot; + c + &quot;, &quot; + d + &quot;, &quot; + e + &quot;, &quot; + f);
</code></pre>
<h2 id="explicit-conversions"><a class="header" href="#explicit-conversions">Explicit Conversions</a></h2>
<p>Any other conversions between numeric types must be explicitly stated in your
code. If we don't do this, then we'll get a syntax error. If we reverse the
order of the types in the last example, we'll see this happen with every line
but the first. Try running the following script in jshell:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">double a = 10;
float b = a;
long c = a;
int d = a;
short e = a;
byte f = a;
</code></pre>
<p>To make this work, we need to state the type we want to convert to in
parenthesis before the expression we wish to convert:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">double a = 10;
float b = (float)a;
long c = (long)a;
int d = (int)a;
short e = (short)a;
byte f = (byte)a;

println(a + &quot;, &quot; + b + &quot;, &quot; + c + &quot;, &quot; + d + &quot;, &quot; + e + &quot;, &quot; + f);
</code></pre>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="strings"><a class="header" href="#strings">Strings</a></h1>
<p>Strings are sequences of characters. They have many applications and come with
useful built-in <a href="types/../quickstart/functions.html#methods">methods</a>, but to begin
we'll mostly use them for producing output. We'll revisit this chapter later to
learn about more advanced string manipulation.</p>
<h2 id="string-literals"><a class="header" href="#string-literals">String Literals</a></h2>
<p>A string literal is text enclosed within double-quotes (<code>&quot;</code>). You can use
<a href="types/./numeric/chars.html#escape-sequences">escape sequences</a> in string literals just
like <code>char</code> literals.</p>
<h2 id="concatenation"><a class="header" href="#concatenation">Concatenation</a></h2>
<p>Anything can be concatenated with a string. The plus sign <code>+</code> performs string
concatenation instead of addition whenever one of the operands is a string.</p>
<p>If one of the operands is a string and the other is a different type, Java will
convert the other operand to a string before concatenating them. The second
operand is then appended to the first operand, forming a new string. For
example, if we concatenated <code>&quot;Hello&quot;</code> with <code>&quot;World&quot;</code> (<code>&quot;Hello&quot; + &quot;World&quot;</code>), we
would get <code>&quot;HelloWorld&quot;</code> (if you want a space, make sure to include it in one of
the operands!).</p>
<p>You can concatenate multiple values together, but remember that the
concatenation will be evaluated left to right. If you want to perform any
arithmetic with numeric values before they are concatenated, you may need to
surround them with parenthesis to ensure the arithmetic happens first. For
example, <code>&quot;sum: &quot; + 2 + 3</code> will result in <code>&quot;sum: 23&quot;</code>. If we wanted to add 2
and 3 before concatenating, we can add parenthesis: <code>&quot;sum: &quot; + (2 + 3)</code> will
result in <code>&quot;sum: 5&quot;</code>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="booleans-1"><a class="header" href="#booleans-1">Booleans</a></h1>
<p>The <code>boolean</code> type can only represent two values: <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. It will
be more relevant later when we learn about <a href="types/../if.html">if statements</a> and
<a href="types/../boolean.html">boolean expressions</a>.</p>

<p>A few notes about the above table:</p>
<ul>
<li>The size is how much of the computer's memory a single value of this type
requires</li>
<li>The <code>char</code> type represents a single text character, but it <code>char</code>s are stored
as integers and will readily convert to an <code>int</code></li>
<li>The main integer types are listed as <strong>signed</strong>, which means they can
represent positive <strong>and</strong> negative numbers (and zero). An unsigned integer type
(such as <code>char</code>) can only represent positive numbers (and zero).</li>
<li>The notation used for the min/max values of floating-point numbers is a form
of scientific notation called &quot;E notation&quot;. The E38 means &quot;multiplied by
10^38,&quot; and the E308 means &quot;multiplied by 10^308&quot;. These are extremely large
numbers, which is why we write them with scientific notation.</li>
<li>The <code>String</code> type is not a primitive type and does not appear on the table</li>

recommend reading the flowcharts section of the book linked above.</p>
<h2 id="software-1"><a class="header" href="#software-1">Software</a></h2>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="sequential-instructions"><a class="header" href="#sequential-instructions">Sequential Instructions</a></h1>
<p>At its core, a flowchart is a sequence of instructions that must be followed in
order.</p>
<h2 id="symbols"><a class="header" href="#symbols">Symbols</a></h2>
<p>You will see most of the symbols below in any flowchart in these notes. This is
mostly redundant with the summary of symbols shown in the textbook.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Terminators</strong>: the capsule shapes mark the start/end of a flowchart</li>
<li><strong>I/O Instructions</strong>: paralellograms indicate an instruction that performs
input or output</li>
<li><strong>Process Instructions</strong>: rectangtles represent most other instructions that
do not involve input or output</li>
<li><strong>Arrows</strong>: each part of a flowchart is connected to one or more
others by arrows</li>
<li><strong>Lines</strong>: if the flowchart reads left to right, top to bottom, then the
arrows can be left off the connections</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="flowcharts/../dia/flowcharts/sequential_symbols.png" alt="Sequential Symbols" /></p>
<h2 id="reading-a-flowchart"><a class="header" href="#reading-a-flowchart">Reading a Flowchart</a></h2>
<p>Beginning with the start terminator, each instruction in the flowchart is
performed in sequence. Below are several examples followed by equivalent jshell
scripts.</p>
<h3 id="hello-world"><a class="header" href="#hello-world">Hello World</a></h3>
<p><img src="flowcharts/../dia/flowcharts/hello_world.png" alt="Hello World" /></p>

println(&quot;Now I'll repeat what you just typed.&quot;)
println(text)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="simple-age"><a class="header" href="#simple-age">Simple Age</a></h3>

int maxAge = currentYear - birthYear
int minAge = maxAge - 1
println(&quot;You are either &quot; + minAge + &quot; or &quot; + maxAge + &quot; years old.&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this last flowchart left out the details of what text the program
should print. Instead, the output instructions focused on the purpose of the
output. This is usually fine; the purpose of our flowchart is to show the
structure of our code, not specify the exact details of its input and output.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="decision-points"><a class="header" href="#decision-points">Decision Points</a></h1>
<p>Decision points allow our flowchart to branch in multiple directions, and the
condition in the decision point determines which branch we follow. All branches
must eventually converge and lead to the flowchart's end terminator.</p>
<h2 id="symbols-1"><a class="header" href="#symbols-1">Symbols</a></h2>
<p>A diamond shape represents a decision or branching point. The text in this
symbol states the condition, which must usually be true or false. Each branch
coming from this symbol is labelled with the result that would cause the program
to follow that branch (again, usually true and false).</p>
<p><img src="flowcharts/../dia/flowcharts/decision_symbols.png" alt="Decision Symbols" /></p>
<h2 id="selection-vs-iteration"><a class="header" href="#selection-vs-iteration">Selection vs Iteration</a></h2>
<p>There are two ways we can use decision points: selection and iteration.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Selection</strong>: the decision point chooses which instruction(s) to perform
next, but these do not lead back to earlier parts of the flowchart and converge
before the end terminator.</li>
<li><strong>Iteration</strong>: the decision point chooses whether to follow a branch that
leads back to an earlier part of the flowchart or to continue towards the end of
the flowchart. Iteration allows us to repeat instructions multiple times until a
condition is met.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Java code, selection is handled with if statements and switch statements.
Iteration is handled with loops (while, do-while, for).</p>
<h2 id="selection-examples"><a class="header" href="#selection-examples">Selection Examples</a></h2>
<p>The flowcharts below demonstrate selection. The equivalent jshell scripts are

<p>This flowchart duplicates an instruction to more closely match the structure of

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="if-statements"><a class="header" href="#if-statements">If Statements</a></h1>
<p>If statements allow a program to make decisions based on user input. With an if
statement, you can ask a yes/no question about some data and decide what code to
execute next based on the answer. This chapter will cover different parts of an
if statement as well as how to use an if statement.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="if"><a class="header" href="#if">If</a></h1>
<p>On its own, an if statement lets the program decide whether or not to run a
block of code. This means the code inside the if block can be skipped. For
example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">println(&quot;Please enter a number less than 100.&quot;);
int number = nextInt();

if (number &lt; 100) {
    println(&quot;Thanks for following directions!&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This program only prints its second message if the user types a number less
than 100. If the user types a number greater than or equal to 100, then the
program will skip the second print statement.</p>
<p>An if statement <a href="if/../templates.html#if-statement">has several parts</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>if</code> keyword</li>
<li>A <strong>condition</strong> in parenthesis after the <code>if</code>, which is always a
<a href="if/../boolean.html">boolean expression</a></li>
<li>An opening curly brace (<code>{</code>) to begin a code block; this code block and its
contents are the <strong>body</strong> of the if statement</li>
<li>Some code indented within the code block</li>
<li>A closing curly brace (<code>}</code>) to end the code block</li>
</ul>
<p>When an if statement is executed, the condition is first evaluated. This will
result in either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. If the condition is <code>true</code>, then the body
of the if statement will execute. If the condition is <code>false</code>, then the program
skips the body and continues executing the rest of the program.</p>
<h2 id="semicolons-1"><a class="header" href="#semicolons-1">Semicolons</a></h2>
<p>Note that we do not include a semicolon on the lines with curly braces. Java
expects that a <strong>statement</strong>, as in a line of code that represents a
complete instruction, will always end in a semicolon. The <code>if (condition) {</code>
line is not an instruction on its own, so we should not place a semicolon on
that line. In general, any time you write a line of code that would normally be
followed by an opening curly brace (such as an if), you should not use a
semicolon on that line.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="comparisons"><a class="header" href="#comparisons">Comparisons</a></h1>
<p>In order to write a condition, you need to be able to write a boolean
expression. One common type of boolean expression is a comparison between two
values. Here are the comparison operators that Java supports:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;</code>: less than</li>
<li><code>&lt;=</code>: less than or equal to</li>
<li><code>&gt;</code>: greater than</li>
<li><code>&gt;=</code>: greater than or equal to</li>
<li><code>==</code>: equal to (a single <code>=</code>
<a href="if/../variables/assignment.html">is an assignment, not a comparison</a>)</li>
<li><code>!=</code>: not equal to</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a few examples of boolean expressions using these comparison operators
along with the equivalent English statement:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>a &gt;= b</code>: <code>a</code> is greater than or equal to <code>b</code></li>
<li><code>year != 2022</code>: <code>year</code> is not equal to <code>2022</code></li>
<li><code>2 + 2 == 5</code>: <code>2 + 2</code> is equal to <code>5</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These will result in <code>true</code> if the comparison is making a true statement, and
<code>false</code> if it is not. For example, <code>a &gt;= b</code> will be true whenever <code>a</code> is greater
than or equal to <code>b</code>, and <code>false</code> when <code>a</code> is less than <code>b</code>. This comparison
contains variables, so its value will depend on those variables. A comparison
between two constant values, such as <code>2 + 2 == 5</code>, will always result in the
same value (in this case, <code>false</code>, because <code>2 + 2</code> is equal to <code>4</code> and not <code>5</code>).</p>

<p>The comparison operators above are only meant to be used with <a href="if/../types/primitives.html">primitive types</a>. If you use them to compare <code>String</code>s or other reference
types, then your code will usually not work correctly.</p>
<p>If you want to compare two strings, you'll need to use the <code>.equals()</code> <a href="if/../quickstart/functions.html#methods">method</a>:</p>

<h2 id="common-mistakes"><a class="header" href="#common-mistakes">Common Mistakes</a></h2>
<p>A few mistakes to avoid with comparisons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>=</code> operator does not check for equality; do not use it in a boolean
expression</li>
<li>Do not check floating-point values for equality with <code>==</code> or <code>!=</code>; the lack of
precision inherent to floating-point numbers will cause false positives and
false negatives</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ranges"><a class="header" href="#ranges">Ranges</a></h2>
<p>You cannot combine comparisons like this: <code>1 &lt;= x &lt;= 10</code>.
This would be a perfectly natural way to state that x is a number from 1 to 10,
and this <em>is</em> how you'd write such a statement in algebra, but your program will
not interpret it the way we might hope. Let's look at how a program will
evaluate the boolean expression <code>1 &lt;= x &lt;= 10</code> while <code>x</code> stores the value <code>7</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we'll substitute the value of <code>x</code>: <code>1 &lt;= 7 &lt;= 10</code>.</li>
<li>Now, <code>1 &lt;= 7 &lt;= 10</code> contains three known values (<code>1</code>, <code>7</code>, and <code>10</code>) and two
operators (the two <code>&lt;=</code> operators). The operators are identical, so we have to
start with the one on the left: <code>1 &lt;= 7</code> is <code>true</code>, because <code>1</code> is less than
<code>7</code>. Therefore, we'll replace <code>1 &lt;= 7</code> with <code>true</code>: <code>true &lt;= 10</code>.</li>
<li>How do we evaluate <code>true &lt;= 10</code>? We can't! This is why you'll see an error if
you try to write a comparison this way.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we want to ask whether <code>x</code> is between <code>1</code> and <code>10</code>, we'll need to write two
separate comparisons and join them with the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> operator to require both to be
<code>true</code> for the whole expression to result in <code>true</code>. <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and other boolean
operations are covered in <a href="if/../boolean.html">the next chapter</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="else"><a class="header" href="#else">Else</a></h1>
<p>Optionally, an if statement may include an else immediately after its body. The
else is followed by its own body, which the program will execute if the
if's condition is <code>false</code> or skip if the if's condition is <code>true</code>. The pattern
<a href="if/../templates.html#if-statement-with-else">looks like this</a>. Note that, like
<code>if (condition) {</code>, <code>else {</code> should never include a semicolon.</p>
<p>An if with no else can either execute or skip a block of code. An if with an
else will always execute either the if block or the else block. If you want your
program to execute additional code some of the time, then you should probably
use an if on its own. If you have two different blocks of code and always want
one or the other to execute, then an if followed by an else is appropriate.</p>
<p>Finally, note that an else <strong>never</strong> has a condition. It will only execute when
the if's condition is false, so a condition is not necessary.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="nested-ifs"><a class="header" href="#nested-ifs">Nested Ifs</a></h1>
<p>We can write an if or if-else inside the body of an if or an else. A common term
for this is &quot;nesting&quot;. Code nested within multiple code blocks should be
indented once for each code block:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">if (condition1) {
    if (condition2) {
        statement1; // nested twice
    } else {
        statement2; // nested twice
    }
} else {
    statement3; // nested once
    if (condition3) {
        if (condition4) {
            statement4; // nested thrice
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>A flowchart equivalent to the above code would look like this:</p>
<p><img src="if/../dia/if/nested.png" alt="Flowchart: Nested Ifs" /></p>
<p>Some people dislike excessive nesting, and I personally find code easier to read
when nesting is kept to a minimum. However, it's a useful tool for combining
multiple if statements or other structures.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="else-if"><a class="header" href="#else-if">Else-If</a></h1>
<p>We'll sometimes want a conditional statement with more than two cases. For
example, what if we wanted to convert a number from 1 to 7 into a day of the
week? We could handle this with nested if-else statements, but it's not great:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int day = nextInt();

if (day == 1) {
    println(&quot;Sunday&quot;);
} else {
    if (day == 2) {
        println(&quot;Monday&quot;);
    } else {
        if (day == 3) {
            println(&quot;Tuesday&quot;);
        } else {
            if (day == 4) {
                println(&quot;Wednesday&quot;);
            } else {
                if (day == 5) {
                    println(&quot;Thursday&quot;);
                } else {
                    if (day == 6) {
                        println(&quot;Friday&quot;);
                    } else {
                        if (day == 7) {
                            println(&quot;Saturday&quot;);
                        } else {
                            println(&quot;Error&quot;);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>We technically don't need to use a code block for an if or an else if there's
only a single statement inside of it. We can even put it on the same line as the
if or the else:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">// The way we've been writing if statements, and the way you should continue to
// write them. The curly brackets usually improve clarity even when they aren't
// technically required.
if (condition) {
    statement;
}

// Note: this won't work in a jshell script
if (condition)
    statement;

if (condition) statement;
</code></pre>
<p>Now, consider that the <code>if (day == 2)</code>, its else, and all of the code inside
their bodies technically qualifies as a single compound statement (albeit, a
very large one). This allows us to remove the nested code blocks and flatten our
previous structure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int day = nextInt();

if (day == 1) {
    println(&quot;Sunday&quot;);
} else if (day == 2) {
    println(&quot;Monday&quot;);
} else if (day == 3) {
    println(&quot;Tuesday&quot;);
} else if (day == 4) {
    println(&quot;Wednesday&quot;);
} else if (day == 5) {
    println(&quot;Thursday&quot;);
} else if (day == 6) {
    println(&quot;Friday&quot;);
} else if (day == 7) {
    println(&quot;Saturday&quot;);
} else {
    println(&quot;Error&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The else-if is not a special language feature, just a consequence of some
lenient formatting rules that allow us to create a &quot;chain&quot; of multiple if-elses.
This second version is much easier to read than the first version, so we see a
significant benefit to leaving out the optional braces after each else (except
the last one). This is one of the few exceptions to our rule about always
including the curly braces after an <code>if</code> or an <code>else</code>.</p>
<p>Here is a flowchart for the else-if chain show above:</p>
<p><img src="if/../dia/if/else_if.png" alt="Flowchart: Else-If Chain" /></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="mistakes-to-avoid"><a class="header" href="#mistakes-to-avoid">Mistakes to Avoid</a></h1>
<h2 id="semicolon-misuse"><a class="header" href="#semicolon-misuse">Semicolon Misuse</a></h2>
<p>With if statements, we've introduced lines of code that don't end in semicolons.
As a general rule, you should never add a semicolon to a line of code that
normally ends in an opening curly brace. If we review the structure of an if
statement, we'll see that this means you <strong>do not</strong> add semicolons after an <code>if</code>
or an <code>else</code>, or the condition of an <code>if</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">if (condition) {
    statement;
} else {
    statement;
}
</code></pre>
<p>We also do not normally put semicolons after curly braces, whether they are
opening or closing braces.</p>
<p>Programmers who aren't used to the rules for semicolons sometimes make the
mistake of adding them where they aren't needed. Depending on where you add the
extra semicolon, it may significantly alter the meaning of your code in a way
you did not expect. For example, what do you think will happen when we run the
following jshell script?</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int x = nextInt();
if (x &lt; 0); {
    println(&quot;You entered a negative number.&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Try running the program and entering different numbers: try a negative number,
zero, and a positive number. Did the program work as you expected?</p>
<p>There's an extra semicolon after the if statement's condition on the second
line. This is valid code, but it probably doesn't mean what the programmer
intended. Java interprets <code>if (condition);</code> as an empty if statement with no
body. Java also allows us to create code blocks that aren't tied to if
statements or other structures. All of this means that the previous program is
equivalent to this program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int x = nextInt();

if (x &lt; 0) {
    ; // Empty statement does nothing
}

// A lone block of code that will always execute, even when x isn't negative!
{
    println(&quot;You entered a negative number.&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>We'd get a similar result if we placed a semicolon after an <code>else</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int x = nextInt();
if (x &lt; 0) {
    println(&quot;You entered a negative number.&quot;);
} else; {
    println(&quot;You entered zero or a positive number.&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the semicolon after the else on the fourth line. Try running this program
and noting when its output is incorrect, then run it without the extra
semicolon. We have the same issue as before: the else's body is actually the
empty statement denoted by the semicolon, and the code block that <em>appears</em> to
be its body is actually completely separate from the if-else.</p>
<h2 id="poor-indentation"><a class="header" href="#poor-indentation">Poor Indentation</a></h2>
<p>You should always indent code nested within a code block, and you should indent
<em>consistently</em>. There's no set amount that you <em>have</em> to indent in Java, but
four spaces is pretty common. Whatever the space you use for one level of
indentation, this should be the same throughout your entire program. Consistent
formatting is important for keeping your code readable by a human.</p>
<p>Some examples of poor indentation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">// No indentation
if (condition1) {
if (condition2) {
statement1;
} else {
statement2;
}
statement3;
}

// Inconsistent: some lines are indented and others are not
if (condition1) {
    if (condition2) {
        statement1;
} else {
    statement2;
}
statement3;
}

// Inconsistent: different numbers of spaces used for indentation
if (condition1) {
  if (condition2) {
      statement1;
   } else {
 statement2;
     }
     statement3;
}

// Inconsistent: first level indents 4 spaces, second level indents 2 spaces
if (condition1) {
    if (condition2) {
      statement1;
    } else {
      statement2;
    }
    statement3;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Below are examples of good indentation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">if (condition1) {
    if (condition2) {
        statement1;
    } else {
        statement2;
    }
    statement3;
}

if (condition1) {
  if (condition2) {
    statement1;
  } else {
    statement2;
  }
  statement3;
}

if (condition1) {
        if (condition2) {
                statement1;
        } else {
                statement2;
        }
        statement3;
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="dangling-else"><a class="header" href="#dangling-else">Dangling Else</a></h2>
<p>Aside from readability and their necessity in jshell scripts, another reason to
always include curly braces is to avoid creating a &quot;dangling else&quot;:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">// Despite the indentation, both versions of this code are identical. How will
// it be interpreted by the computer?

// Version A
if (condition1)
    if (condition2)
        statement1;
else
    statement2;

// Version B
if (condition1)
    if (condition2)
        statement1;
    else
        statement2;

// If you would like to check this in a jshell script, you'll need to put
// everything on one line and replace the placeholders with actual code. Try it
// with each combination of true/false values for the conditions and try to
// determine whether version A or B is correct.
bool condition1 = true;
bool condition2 = true;
if (condition1) if (condition2) println(&quot;statement1&quot;); else println(&quot;statement2&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>The following two flowcharts show the difference in logic implied by the
indentation:</p>
<p>Version A:</p>
<p><img src="if/../dia/if/dangling_else_a.png" alt="Flowchart: Dangling Else Version A" /></p>
<p>Version B:</p>
<p><img src="if/../dia/if/dangling_else_b.png" alt="Flowchart: Dangling Else Version B" /></p>
<p>If you test this code, you'll see that version B describes what actually
happens. The else is attached to the closest if statement it can be attached to.
The fact that we have a rule for how to consistently interpret this makes it
unambiguous to the computer, but to a human it can be unclear how to interpret
this code. The use of curly braces and proper indentation removes all ambiguity,
makes it easier to read, and allows us to tell the computer to use either
interpretation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">// If we meant for it to be interpreted as version A, curly braces can make this
// happen
if (condition1) {
    if (condition2) {
        statement1;
    }
} else {
    statement2;
}

// If we meant for it be interpreted as version B, curly braces clarify our
// intent
if (condition1) {
    if (condition2) {
        statement1;
    } else {
        statement2;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Accidental <a href="if/../variables/scope.html#shadowing">shadowing</a> is a common cause of
errors when writing if statements. Make sure you understand the difference
between declaring/initializing and reassigning variables so that you can avoid
this type of error.</p>
<p>A similar problem can occur if you declare a variable in the wrong scope. If you
want to initialize a variable inside of an if statement, it may be tempting to
declare it inside of the if statement. However, if you intend to use it outside
of the if statement, then this will not work. See the example in the section
covering <a href="if/../variables/scope.html">variable scope</a>.</p>
<p>If you want your if statement to initialize a variable, I recommend declaring it

<p>The <code>boolean</code> type has only two possible values: <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. We can use
several operators with these values to form larger boolean expressions to use
with <code>if</code> statements and other constructs to ask complex questions. This chapter
will focus on understanding the boolean logic operations and how to use them.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="boolean-operators"><a class="header" href="#boolean-operators">Boolean Operators</a></h1>
<p>There are four boolean logic operators we need to cover: AND, OR, XOR, and NOT.
These operators take one or two boolean operands and result in a new boolean
value.
In Java and many other programming languages, these operators are written as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>AND: <code>&amp;&amp;</code></li>
<li>OR (inclusive OR): <code>||</code></li>
<li>XOR (e<strong>X</strong>clusive OR): <code>^^</code></li>
<li>NOT: <code>!</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="and"><a class="header" href="#and">AND</a></h2>
<p>If I were to say &quot;it's going to rain and snow tomorrow,&quot; then my statement will
only be true if it both rains and snows tomorrow.
If it only rains, only snows, or doesn't rain or snow, then my statement is
false. This is how the boolean AND works.</p>
<p><code>a &amp;&amp; b</code> only results in <code>true</code> if both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are both <code>true</code>. If at least
one operand is <code>false</code>, then <code>a &amp;&amp; b</code> results in <code>false</code>.</p>
<h2 id="or-and-xor"><a class="header" href="#or-and-xor">OR and XOR</a></h2>
<p>In English, the word &quot;or&quot; can be used inclusively or exclusively: an inclusive
'or' allows both options to be true, and an exclusive 'or' requires exactly one
to be true. For example, consider the following two statements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tomorrow it's at least going to rain or snow. (<em>inclusive</em>)</li>
<li>Due to the weather, school will either start late or be cancelled entirely.
(<em>exclusive</em>)</li>
</ol>
<p>The first sentence would be true if it both rained and snowed.
In the second sentence, the options presented are mutually exclusive; only one
can be true.</p>
<p><code>a || b</code> (inclusive or) always results in <code>true</code> unless both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are
<code>false</code>. If both operands are <code>false</code>, then <code>a || b</code> results in <code>false</code>.
<code>a ^^ b</code> (exclusive or) results in <code>true</code> if <strong>exactly one</strong> of its
operands is <code>true</code> and the other is false. <code>a ^^ b</code> results in <code>false</code> if both
of its operands are <code>true</code> or both are <code>false</code>. You can also say <code>a ^^ b</code> is
<code>true</code> if <code>a</code> isn't equal to <code>b</code>, or <code>false</code> if <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are the same.</p>
<h2 id="not"><a class="header" href="#not">NOT</a></h2>
<p>The NOT operator only applies to one operand. <code>!a</code> results in the opposite of
whatever <code>a</code> is equal to: <code>true</code> if <code>a</code> is <code>false</code>, or <code>false</code> if <code>a</code> is <code>true</code>.
This is how the word &quot;not&quot; is used in English. If I say &quot;I'm not going out
tomorrow,&quot; that statement is true if I don't go out and false if I do go out.</p>
<h2 id="truth-table"><a class="header" href="#truth-table">Truth Table</a></h2>

<p>Sometimes, a boolean expression involving the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> or <code>||</code> operator can be fully
evaluated without checking the second operand. In these situations, the computer
will skip evaluating the second operand, and this is called &quot;short-circuiting&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="when-do-we-short-circuit"><a class="header" href="#when-do-we-short-circuit">When Do We Short-Circuit?</a></h2>
<p>There are two situations where we can short-circuit a boolean expression:</p>
<ul>
<li>When we are ANDing two values (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>) and we see that the first value is
<code>false</code>, we don't need to check the second value to know that the result is
<code>false</code>. This is because an AND results in <code>false</code> unless both operands are
<code>true</code>.</li>
<li>When we are ORing two values (<code>||</code>) and we see that the first value is <code>true</code>,
we don't need to check the second value to know that the result is <code>true</code>. This
is because an OR results in <code>true</code> unless both operands are <code>false</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see this if you check the <a href="boolean/./operators.html#truth-table">truth table</a>
shown in the operators section. Both rows where <code>a</code> is <code>false</code> result in <code>false</code>
for <code>a &amp;&amp; b</code>, and both rows where <code>a</code> is <code>true</code> result in <code>true</code> for <code>a || b</code>.
You don't need to know what's in column <code>b</code> in either of those situations to
tell me what's going to be in the column for <code>&amp;&amp;</code> or <code>||</code>. This is why we can
&quot;short-circuit&quot; and skip looking in column <code>b</code>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if <code>a</code> is <code>true</code>, then you still need to check <code>b</code> to
determine what's under <code>a &amp;&amp; b</code>, and if <code>a</code> is <code>false</code>, then you still need to
check <code>b</code> to determine what's under <code>a || b</code>. In these situations, we need to
evaluate <code>b</code> before we know the result of the expression. This means we cannot
short-circuit.</p>
<h2 id="uses"><a class="header" href="#uses">Uses</a></h2>
<p>Short-circuiting can be useful when we want to evaluate two boolean expressions,
but one of them will cause an error in certain situations. For example, we're
not allowed to divide integers by zero. If we want to divide two unknown
integers, we need to make sure they aren't zero first:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int x = nextInt();
int y = nextInt();

if (y != 0) {
    println(x / y);
} else {
    println(&quot;We can't divide by zero!&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Let's say we want to know whether <code>x / y</code> is an even number. We could write our
code like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int x = nextInt();
int y = nextInt();

if (y != 0) {
    if ((x / y) % 2 == 0) {
        println(&quot;x / y is even&quot;);
    } else {
        println(&quot;x / y is not even&quot;);
    }
} else {
    println(&quot;x / y is not even&quot;); // if we can't divide x / y, then it's not even
}
</code></pre>
<p>However, that's long and repetitive. We can simplify this code by taking
advantage of short-circuiting:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int x = nextInt();
int y = nextInt();

if (y != 0 &amp;&amp; (x / y) % 2 == 0) {
    println(&quot;x / y is even&quot;);
} else {
    println(&quot;x / y is not even&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>If the first part, <code>y != 0</code>, is false, then <code>y</code> <em>is</em> zero and dividing will
cause an error. However, if we have <code>false</code> followed by <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, then we don't need
to evaluate the part after the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> to know that the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> results in <code>false</code>.
Java will use this fact to skip evaluating the <code>(x / y) % 2 == 0</code>, and we won't
divide by zero and cause an error.</p>
<p>We can use <code>||</code> to ask the same question with short-circuiting if we change the
comparisons:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int x = nextInt();
int y = nextInt();

if (y == 0 || (x / y) % 2 != 0) {
    println(&quot;x / y is not even&quot;);
} else {
    println(&quot;x / y is even&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="early-java-api"><a class="header" href="#early-java-api">Early Java API</a></h1>
<p>The acronym &quot;API&quot; stands for Application Programming Interface. It refers to the
public-facing part of a program or code library that other code can interact
with. For example, the Java language has a large standard library with a
well-documented API that you'll use more as you learn the language. This chapter
will introduce a few parts of Java's API that will be useful in some of the
programs you are currently writing or will write in the near future.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="math"><a class="header" href="#math">Math</a></h1>
<p>Java's <code>Math</code> class is a collection of functions and constants that are used in
many programs. We'll cover a few that may be relevant to you in the near future,
but you can always view the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Math.html">online documentation</a>
if you want to see what else is available.</p>
<p>We've not yet explained the term <strong>class</strong>, and it won't be that relevant until
we switch to compiled Java. For now, think of a class as a container for other
code, such as the constants and functions described below.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-math-api"><a class="header" href="#using-the-math-api">Using the Math API</a></h2>
<p>You can access any of the functions or constants in the <code>Math</code> class by typing
<code>Math.</code> followed by the name of that constant or function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">// prints the value of PI
println(Math.PI);

int a = nextInt();
int b = nextInt();
// prints the larger of the two numbers entered by the user
println(Math.max(a, b));
</code></pre>
<h2 id="constants"><a class="header" href="#constants">Constants</a></h2>
<p>There are only a few constants in the <code>Math</code> class, but they are frequently
used in mathematics and may be relevant to some of your programs:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Math.PI</code> is an approximation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi">pi</a></li>
<li><code>Math.TAU</code> is an approximation of pi doubled</li>
<li><code>Math.E</code> is an approximation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant)">e</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="functions-1"><a class="header" href="#functions-1">Functions</a></h2>
<p>The functions shown below will use placeholder variable names, which you should
replace with the appropriate variables or literals from your program when you
use these functions.</p>
<p>Some of the functions in <code>Math</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Math.abs(x)</code> takes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value">absolute value</a> of <code>x</code></li>
<li><code>Math.ceil(x)</code>, <code>Math.floor(x)</code>, and <code>Math.round(x)</code> all round <code>x</code> (ceil
always rounds up, floor always rounds down, and round follows standard rounding
rules)</li>
<li><code>Math.max(x, y)</code> and <code>Math.min(x, y)</code> returns the largest (max) or smallest
(min) of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code></li>
<li><code>Math.pow(x, y)</code> raises <code>x</code> to the power of <code>y</code></li>
<li><code>Math.sqrt(x)</code> returns the square root of <code>x</code></li>
<li><code>Math.random()</code> generates a random number from 0.0 to 1.0 (excluding 1.0)</li>
<li><code>Math.toDegrees(x)</code> and <code>Math.toRadians(x)</code> convert the angle <code>x</code> from radians
to degrees or from degrees to radians</li>
<li>Many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry">trigonometric</a> functions,
such as <code>Math.sin(x)</code>, <code>Math.cos(x)</code>, and <code>Math.tan(x)</code>, are included in the
<code>Math</code> class</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="string"><a class="header" href="#string">String</a></h1>
<p>Java's strings come with a bunch of useful <strong>methods</strong>, which are functions
attached to objects. Unlike the various <a href="early_api/../types/primitives.html">primitive types</a> we've covered, strings are objects that contain both
information (the characters in the strings) and methods (functions that operate
on those characters). We can call these methods on any string literal or
variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">String name = &quot;zach&quot;;
println(name);
println(name.toUpperCase());
println(name.charAt(3));
println(name);
println(&quot;hello&quot;.substring(1));
println(&quot;HElLo&quot;.toLowerCase());
</code></pre>
<p>A note about all of these methods: Java's strings are <strong>immutable</strong>, which means
they cannot be modified after they are created. Converting a string to all
uppercase letters does not change the original string, it creates a new string
with the same text, but all of the letters are capitalized. This can be observed
when we print <code>name</code> for a second time in the previous example. Any method you
call on a string will leave the original intact.</p>
<h2 id="indexes"><a class="header" href="#indexes">Indexes</a></h2>
<p>The term <strong>index</strong> refers to the position of something in a sequence. In Java
and most other programming languages, the index 0 corresponds to the first
position within a sequence, the index 1 corresponds to the second position,
and so on. This is called &quot;zero-indexing&quot;, and it applies to any index of a
character within a string. For example, the <code>'H'</code> in <code>&quot;Hello, world!&quot;</code> is at
index 0, and the <code>','</code> is at index 5.</p>
<h2 id="string-methods"><a class="header" href="#string-methods">String Methods</a></h2>
<p>As with <code>Math</code>, you can read the full <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html">API page for string</a>
if you'd like to see more detail than I've provided in this section. These
methods will also be shown with placeholder variables (<code>s</code>, <code>s1</code>, <code>s2</code>, etc. for
strings, <code>c</code>, <code>c1</code>, <code>c2</code>, etc. for characters, and <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, etc. for numbers).
Replace these with the appropriate variables or literals from your own code when
using these methods.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>s1.equals(s2)</code> returns <code>true</code> if <code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code> have the exact same sequence
of characters and false if they do not</li>
<li><code>s1.equalsIgnoreCase(s2)</code> is like <code>.equals</code>, but it ignores differences in
capitalization</li>
<li><code>s.length()</code> returns the number of characters in <code>s</code></li>
<li><code>s.toUpperCase()</code> and <code>s.toLowerCase()</code> convert all of the letters in <code>s</code> to
uppercase or lowercase letters</li>
<li><code>s.charAt(x)</code> returns the character at index <code>x</code> in <code>s</code></li>
<li><code>s.indexOf(c)</code> returns the index where the character <code>c</code> first appears in <code>s</code></li>
<li><code>s.lastIndexOf(c)</code> returns the index where the character <code>c</code> last appears in
<code>s</code></li>
<li><code>s1.startsWith(s2)</code> and <code>s1.endsWith(s2)</code> return true if <code>s1</code> starts/ends with
<code>s2</code> and false if it does not</li>
<li><code>s.substring(x)</code> returns a string containing every character in <code>s</code> from
index <code>x</code> until the end of <code>s</code></li>
<li><code>s.substring(x, y)</code> returns a string containing every character in <code>s</code> from
index <code>x</code> up to (but not including) index <code>y</code></li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="loops"><a class="header" href="#loops">Loops</a></h1>
<p>Loops allow a program to repeat a block of code an arbitrary number of times.
Learning to use loops will vastly increase what you are able to accomplish with
a few lines of code.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="while-loop"><a class="header" href="#while-loop">While Loop</a></h1>
<p>The first type of loop we'll loop at is called a <code>while</code> loop. This loop will
repeat its body for as long as some condition remains true. For example, if we
want to print the numbers 1 to 100, we can write a loop that adds 1 to a
variable and prints it for as long as that variable is less than 100.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int x = 0;
while (x &lt; 100) {
    x = x + 1;
    println(x);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This code is equivalent to the following flowchart:</p>
<p><img src="loops/../dia/loops/while1.png" alt="Flowchart: 1 to 100 While Loop" /></p>
<h2 id="structure-of-a-while-loop"><a class="header" href="#structure-of-a-while-loop">Structure of a While Loop</a></h2>
<p>A while loop has the same structure as an if statement:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>while</code> keyword</li>
<li>A condition (boolean expression) in parenthesis after the <code>while</code></li>
<li>A body (a code block enclosed within curly braces)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="loops/../templates.html#while-loop">templates section</a> shows this structure along
with another example loop.</p>
<p>The two differences between an if statement and a while loop are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The while loop repeats for as long as its condition is true, and the if
statement does not repeat (this is why we don't call an if statement an &quot;if
loop&quot;).</li>
<li>The while loop does not allow for an optional else when its condition is
false.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="infinite-loops"><a class="header" href="#infinite-loops">Infinite Loops</a></h2>
<p>Several common mistakes can create infinite loops, which are loops that will
never terminate on their own. When a program encounters an infinite loop, it
will remain stuck in the loop until the user forces the program to stop.</p>
<h3 id="semicolon"><a class="header" href="#semicolon">Semicolon</a></h3>
<p>One way to accidentally create an infinite loop is to place a semicolon after
the condition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">while (condition); {
    statements;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is similar to misusing semicolons after if statements, but the effect is
different. This creates an empty loop, which will never change its condition and
therefore never terminate (technically you could have such a loop terminate if
the condition were able to change on its own, but this isn't typical). Like the
if statement, the code shown above is equivalent to this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">while (condition) {
    ; // empty statement
}

// unconditional code block, which would execute if we could ever reach it
{
    statements;
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="update-doesnt-match-condition"><a class="header" href="#update-doesnt-match-condition">Update Doesn't Match Condition</a></h3>
<p>In most cases, this type of loop will technically terminate due to integer
overflow, but it'll take far longer than you intended. If you're counting up
with a condition that expects you to get below a certain value, or are counting
down with a condition that expects you to get above a certain value, then your
loop will not end until your counter variable overflows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int x = 100;
while (x &gt; 0) {
    // This should be x = x - 1
    x = x + 1;
    println(x);
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-java">int x = 1;
while (x &lt;= 100) {
    // This should be x = x + 1
    x = x - 1;
    println(x);
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="no-update-step"><a class="header" href="#no-update-step">No Update Step</a></h3>
<p>Many while loops have a statement that serves to update its condition. A good
example would be a <a href="loops/./counting.html">counting loop</a>, which always has a statement
that increases or decreases its counting variable. If we forget this update step
in a loop that requires it, then the condition will always be true and the loop
will never terminate.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int x = 0;
while (x &lt; 10) {
    println(x);
    // we forgot to include x = x + 1;
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="accidental-shadowing"><a class="header" href="#accidental-shadowing">Accidental Shadowing</a></h3>
<p>Like the semicolon problem, <a href="loops/../variables/scope.html#shadowing">accidental shadowing</a> can occur in while loops the same way it occurs
in <a href="loops/../if/mistakes.html#variable-scope-and-shadowing">if statement</a>. The result
will usually be an infinite loop if we shadow a variable used in the condition.
Fortunately, some forms of accidental shadowing are not valid syntax and will
produce a syntax error.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int number = 0;
while (number &lt; 1 || number &gt; 10) {
    println(&quot;Please enter a number from 1 to 10.&quot;);
    // This will compile and cause an infinite loop because we're not
    // reassigning the original number variable
    int number = nextInt();
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-java">int x = 0;
while (x &lt; 10) {
    println(x);
    // This will not compile because we're declaring a new x variable while
    // using the old x to initialize it. Syntax errors are usually easier to fix
    // than other types of errors.
    int x = x + 1;
}
</code></pre>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="do-while-loop"><a class="header" href="#do-while-loop">Do-While Loop</a></h1>
<p>A do-while loop is a slight variant of a while loop. It checks its condition at
the end of the loop rather than at the beginning, so it will always execute the
body at least once, even if its condition is initally false. Compare the
following code and flowchart to the <a href="loops/./while.html">while loop</a> flowchart to see
the difference:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int x = 0;
do {
    x = x + 1;
    println(x);
} while (x &lt; 100);
</code></pre>
<p><img src="loops/../dia/loops/do1.png" alt="Flowchart: Do-While Loop" /></p>
<p>The structure of a do-while loop is similar to a while loop, with two small
differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>The loop begins with the <code>do</code> keyword and no condition</li>
<li>We still use the <code>while</code> keyword, but after the loop's body, and there is a
semicolon after the condition</li>
</ul>
<p>The do-while loop exists purely for convenience, and chance are you'll rarely
use it. It's worth using when it makes your code clearer or more concise, but
you can always use a standard while loop to accomplish the same thing.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="counting-loop"><a class="header" href="#counting-loop">Counting Loop</a></h1>
<p>A counting loop repeats a set number of times, using a variable to count the
current number of repetitions. Counting loops are useful if you know how many
times you want your loop to execute its body, or if your program can calculate
the necessary number of repetitions before the loop begins.</p>
<p>It's usually preferable to use a <a href="loops/./for.html">for loop</a> when you want a counting
loop, but we'll introduce it using while loop syntax.</p>
<p>A counting loop will usually look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">// variable to track total repetitions
int count = 0;

// loop ends when we reach the total
while (count &lt; totalRepetitions) {
    // whatever work the loop is supposed to do goes here
    ...

    // we usually increment our count variable at the end of the loop
    count = count + 1;
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="example-count-downcount-up"><a class="header" href="#example-count-downcount-up">Example: Count Down/Count Up</a></h2>
<p>Printing a sequence of numbers is a suitable task for a counting loop. We can
count from 1 to 10 with the following loop:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int count = 0;

while (count &lt; 10) {
    println(count + 1);

    count = count + 1;
}
</code></pre>
<p>There are many ways we could structure this loop. This first example follows the
exact same pattern as the example, but there are different ways we could
simplify it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int count = 1;

while (count &lt;= 10) {
    println(count);

    count = count + 1;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Since we want to print numbers from 1 to 10, not 0 to 9, we can change our
<code>count</code> value's range to be the exact numbers we're printing. It doesn't matter
if the counting loop starts counting at 0, or whether it counts up or down or by
increments other than 1. Go with whatever makes sense for the task at hand.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int count = 0;

while (count &lt; 10) {
    count = count + 1;

    println(count);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This loop increments the <code>count</code> variable before the print statement so that we
don't have to add one inside the print statement. I prefer to avoid moving the
increment step away from the end of the loop for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>If it's always at the end of the loop, it stands out and is easy to find.</li>
<li>The value changes during that step, so any code referring to the <code>count</code> will
get a different value depending on whether it's before or after the increment
step.</li>
</ul>
<p>This comes down to personal preference and sticking to familiar patterns to
lower the chances that I'll make a careless mistake.</p>
<p>I mentioned that a counting loop could count up or down, so let's take a look at
a loop that prints a countdown. I'll start off by forcing it to follow the
original template and make its variable count up from zero, then show a cleaner
version that adjusts the range to suit the task:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int count = 0;

while (count &lt; 10) {
    // We can do a bit of math to ensure we print a countdown even though our
    // count variable is increasing
    println(10 - count);

    count = count + 1;
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-java">int count = 10;

while (count &gt; 0) {
    // Now that the range is equal to the numbers we want to print and in the
    // order we want to print them, we can print the count directly
    println(count);

    count = count - 1;
}
</code></pre>
<p>There are two reasons that I prefer the second version:</p>
<ul>
<li>The code is slightly clearer because the range of numbers used for the count
is the same as the numbers we want to print.</li>
<li>The top end of the range, 10 only appears once. Repeating code or information
is usually bad, because if we need to go back and change it we always have a
chance to introduce a bug by forgetting one of the copies we were supposed to
update.</li>
</ul>
<p>The count up/count down loop isn't too complex, and there are many ways you can
adjust it. Try making it count by 2 or 3 instead of 1, or count through a range
of numbers entered by the user (for example, if the user typed 2 and 14, then
the loop would print the numbers 2 to 14).</p>
<h2 id="example-read-set-amount-of-input"><a class="header" href="#example-read-set-amount-of-input">Example: Read Set Amount of Input</a></h2>
<p>In the previous example, we needed to use the <code>count</code> variable in the task that
the loop is repeating. Sometimes we don't care about the value of <code>count</code> and
just want to repeat something a set number of times.</p>
<p>Try coding this program on your own before you look at my solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask the user to enter ten integers, then print the sum after they enter the
last number.</li>
<li>Your code should only include a single call to <code>nextInt()</code>. You could write
this program by writing <code>nextInt()</code> ten times, but the point is to use a loop.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="loops/../dia/loops/counting1.png" alt="Flowchart: Sum Ten Ints" /></p>
<p>Here's my solution:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">println(&quot;Please enter ten integers.&quot;);

int sum = 0;

// It's common practice to name count variables i
int i = 0;

while (i &lt; 10) {
    int input = nextInt();
    sum = sum + input;

    i = i + 1;
}

println(&quot;The sum of your numbers is &quot; + sum + &quot;.&quot;);
</code></pre>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="flag-controlled-loops"><a class="header" href="#flag-controlled-loops">Flag-Controlled Loops</a></h1>
<p>A flag-controlled loop is a while loop that uses a boolean <strong>flag</strong> variable to
control when the loop ends rather than putting the logic in its condition. A
flag-controlled loop can simplify your loop's condition, remove duplicate code,
and make your code overall easier to read when used appropriately.</p>
<p>A flag-controlled loop will usually look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">// a boolean variable tells us whether to continue the loop
boolean flag = true;

// instead of using boolean logic in our condition, we check our flag value
while (flag) {
    // whatever work we want the loop to do goes here
    ...

    // at some point we need to check whether to change our flag value and end
    // the loop
    if (loopShouldEnd) {
        flag = false;
    }

    // we might do additional work after the flag check, but this would still
    // happen even if the flag is set to false

    // we can have multiple checks that potentially end the loop
    if (loopShouldEndForAnotherReason) {

<p>The code below functions identically to the flag-controlled loop, but it does
not use a flag variable.</p>

<p>There are pros and cons to each version of the code:</p>
<ul>
<li>The flag condition (<code>!validInput</code>) is easier to read than the non-flag
condition (<code>number &lt; 0 || factor &lt; 0 || number % factor != 0</code>).</li>
<li>The flag loop avoids duplicating the conditions between the loop and the if
statements. Duplicate code makes it easier to introduce errors: you have to
remember to change each copy if you modify the program, which is easy to forget.</li>
<li>The version without the flag is more concise, which means there is less code
to read and fewer places for us to make mistakes.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you're choosing how to structure your code, you should consider the
benefits and drawbacks of each approach. I would probably use a flag in this
case, but if we weren't including error messages we don't benefit much from a
flag variable:</p>
<ul>
<li>The duplicate code was in the if statements that print error messages, and
removing the error messages would mean neither version duplicates code.</li>
<li>The flagless code would remove the if statements entirely, whereas the flag
code must include an if statement at the end just for breaking out of the
loop.</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider the pros and cons of each version of this program. Which do you prefer?</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="for-loop"><a class="header" href="#for-loop">For Loop</a></h1>
<p>The for loop exists to make it easier to code certain types of loops, such as
counting loops. With a while loop, we need to declare and initialize the
counting variable before the loop, check the value in the loop's condition, and
update the counting variable's value in the loop's body:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int i = 0; // init

while (i &lt; 100) { // condition
    println(i);

    i = i + 1; // update
}
</code></pre>
<p>A for loop lets us combine all three of these steps in the parenthesis after the
<code>for</code> keyword:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">for (int i = 0 /*init*/; i &lt; 100 /*condition*/; i = i + 1 /*update*/) {
    println(i);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The for loop is an example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar">syntactic sugar</a>, or something that isn't strictly
necessary, but that makes it easier or clearer to write some kind of code. The
for loop is generally going to be more concise than a counting while loop, and
putting all of the counting logic in the same place can make it easier to read.
Any loop that can be written as a while loop can be written as a for loop, and
any loop that can be written as a for loop can be written as a while loop. You
should use whichever one seems best suited to the problem you are solving.</p>
<h2 id="abbreviations-for-incrementing-variables"><a class="header" href="#abbreviations-for-incrementing-variables">Abbreviations for Incrementing Variables</a></h2>
<p>You may or may not have seen the <code>+=</code>, <code>++</code>, <code>-=</code>, and <code>--</code> operators before,
but they're commonly used with for loops. These operators allow you to more
concisely increment (increase the value of) or decrement (decrease the value of)
a variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int i = 0;

// the following lines of code all increase the value of i by 1
i = i + 1;
i += 1;
i++;
++i;

// the following lines of code all decrease the value of i by 1
i = i - 1;
i -= 1;
i--;
--i;
</code></pre>
<p>There is technically a small difference between putting the <code>++</code> and <code>--</code>
operator before or after a variable, but this only matters if you are using it
in an expression: <code>int x = i++</code> and <code>int x = ++i</code> will result in different
values for <code>x</code>. Otherwise, it isn't going to matter which way you write these
operators, so go with the style you prefer. I also tend to avoid using them in
situations where they behave differently because it can make the code harder to
read.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="functions-2"><a class="header" href="#functions-2">Functions</a></h1>
<p>Functions were briefly mentioned in the quickstart chapter, and you've been
using several functions for a while: <code>println</code>, <code>nextLine</code>, and the other I/O
commands are all functions.</p>
<p>We could technically write our programs without using functions, but in reality
this would be impractical. Functions offer many benefits, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abstraction: it's often convenient to tell the computer to perform a task and
not worry about the details. If we had to look at each step of every task the
computer performed, down to the low-level instructions executed by the CPU, then
we would be overwhelmed with information and find it difficult to write any code.
Consider printing to the terminal: do you know how your program takes a string
and makes it appear on the terminal? It's a much more complicated process than
you might expect, but because Java includes a <code>println</code> function to handle this
for you, you can tell your program to produce output without worrying about
every little detail.</li>
<li>Organization: we can define functions for different parts of our program,
breaking it into smaller parts that we can write one at a time. The larger
a program is, the more important it is to keep code organized.</li>
<li>Testing: when we want to test our program, it's much easier to test individual
functions than it is to test the entire program at once. This type of test is
called a <strong>unit test</strong>, and it's heavily used in most software projects to
ensure code works as intended.</li>
<li>Avoid Repetition: when we copy-paste or write the same code in multiple
places, we make our code longer and add opportunities to make mistakes. Longer
code takes more effort to read and modify, and if we change code that appears in
several places then we can easily forget to update every occurrence of that
code. It's usually better to write the code once as a function and call the
function when we need to use that code.</li>
</ul>
<p>We've already benefitted from the abstractions provided by Java's built-in
functions, but to fully benefit from functions we need to know how to write our
own. This chapter will cover how to do this in a Jshell script.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="defining-functions-in-jshell"><a class="header" href="#defining-functions-in-jshell">Defining Functions in Jshell</a></h1>
<p>A function definition has the following parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the function returns a value, then it should begin with a return type,
which tells us what type of value it returns. If a function doesn't return a
value, then it should begin with the keyword <code>void</code>.</li>
<li>The function has a name after the return type. Function names follow the
standard rules for <a href="jshell/functions/../../variables/names.html">Java identifiers</a> that we learned
for variable names.</li>
<li>If the function has any parameters, then these are listed in parenthesis after
the function name. If the function has no parameters, then we must still include
a set of empty parenthesis after the name.</li>
<li>The function's body (the code it will execute) goes inside a code block after
the parameter list.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>&lt;return type&gt; &lt;function name&gt;(&lt;parameter list&gt;) {
    &lt;function body&gt;
}
</code></pre>
<p>A function's parameters tell the program what information the function needs to
receive from the code that calls it. A parameter acts like a variable, but its
initial value is supplied when we call it. The parameter list just looks like a
comma-separated list of variable declarations. For example, if a function needed
two parameters, a double and a boolean, then its parameter list might look like
this: <code>functionName(double x, boolean y)</code>. Like variable names, function and
parameter names should be descriptive whenever possible. I've used generic names
here because we have no further context for what these parameters mean. If they
referred to a distance and whether that distance was in metric units, then we
might instead write <code>functionName(double distance, boolean isMetric)</code>.</p>
<h2 id="return-values"><a class="header" href="#return-values">Return Values</a></h2>
<p>If a function is meant to create information for another part of the program to
use, then it should <strong>return</strong> that information to the code that called it. You
have already used functions with return values: all of the input functions (
<code>nextLine</code>, <code>nextInt</code>, etc.) return the value they read from the user, and all
of the <code>Math</code> functions (<code>abs</code>, <code>min</code>, <code>sqrt</code>, etc.) return the number they
calculated.</p>
<p>If we want our function to return a value, then we need to include the value's
type before the name. We also need to give our function a <strong>return statement</strong>
that includes the value it returns. A return statement is the <code>return</code> keyword
followed by an expression whose type matches the function's return type. For
example, if we had a function that adds two <code>double</code> values, then its return
statement might look like this: <code>return x + y;</code>, where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are the
function's parameters. The entire function would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">double add(double x, double y) {
    return x + y;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This isn't a useful function because it's easier to add by writing <code>2 + 3</code> than
by calling our function with <code>add(2, 3)</code>. This is just a short function that
demonstrates what a return statement looks like.</p>
<p>If our function has a return type, then it must <em>always</em> return a value of that
type. It should not be possible for such a function to end without returning.
For example, take a look at the following <code>divide</code> function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int divide(int x, int y) {
    if (y != 0) {
        return x / y;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is not a valid function because when <code>y</code> is equal to <code>0</code>, the function does
not return a value. It must either always return a value or never return a
value. There are exceptions (and they're literally called <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/index.html">exceptions</a>), but
for now all of our functions must return something if they have a return type.
We don't have a good way to handle errors yet, so the best we can do for now is
let our <code>divide</code> function attempt the division and crash if it divides by zero:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int divide(int x, int y) {
    return x / y;
}
</code></pre>
<p>When new programmers are using if statements or loops in a function and have
multiple return statements, it's common to accidentally write functions like the
first version of divide that aren't guaranteed to return a value. A few tips for
avoiding this:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your return statement is inside an if statement, make sure that if
statement has an <code>else</code> clause with its own return statement.</li>
<li>If you have an else-if chain with return statements inside the bodies of the
ifs/else-ifs, then make sure the chain ends with an <code>else</code> and that this <code>else</code>
contains a return statement.</li>
<li>If you have a return statement inside of a loop, then you should probably have
a default return statement at the end of the function body in case the loop is
never executed or the return statement inside the loop is never triggered.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, note that as soon as a function reaches a return statement, the
function will stop executing. If you put code after a return statement, it will
never execute:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int divide(int x, int y) {
    return x / y;
    println(&quot;This will never be printed!&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="practice"><a class="header" href="#practice">Practice</a></h2>
<p>Here are a few descriptions of small functions we could write. Try writing a few
of them yourself before looking at the solutions.</p>
<p>Before you write a function definition, it may help to answer two questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does this function require any parameters? If it always does the same thing,
or it doesn't rely on input from other parts of the program, then it probably
doesn't need parameters.</li>
<li>Does this function return anything? If another part of the program would want
to use a value created by the function, then it should return that value.
Printing a value is not the same as returning it, and if the function's only job
is to print something then it probably doesn't return a value.</li>
</ul>
<p>The function descriptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>A function named <code>sayHello</code> that prints the message &quot;Hello, World!&quot;.</li>
<li>A function named <code>greetPerson</code> that takes a name and prints a greeting in the
form of &quot;Hello &lt;name&gt;, how are you doing today?&quot;.</li>
<li>A function named <code>square</code> that calculates (but does not print) the square of
an integer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">void sayHello() {
    println(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
}

void greetPerson(String name) {
    println(&quot;Hello &quot; + name + &quot;, how are you doing today?&quot;);
}

int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Solution explanations:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>sayHello</code> function does not require any parameter input because it
always does the same thing. No part of the function's behavior needs to change,
and it doesn't need additional information to print &quot;Hello, World!&quot;. The
function is printing rather than producing information for another part of the
program, so it also doesn't need to return anything. This is why its return type
is <code>void</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>greetPerson</code> function is supposed to greet someone by name, but the
description does not say what name we're supposed to use. Instead, it's supposed
to take any name and insert it into a message, which means it needs us to tell
it what name to print. This is why we have a <code>name</code> parameter. As with the
<code>sayHello</code> function, we're not producing information to use in other parts of
the program, we're sending information outside of the program with <code>println</code>.
This means we don't need to return anything, and our return type is <code>void</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>square</code> function needs to know what number it's squaring, and the number
is supposed to be an <code>int</code> according to the description, so we need a single
parameter with the type <code>int</code>. This parameter doesn't mean anything beyond the
fact that it's a number, so an arbitrary name like <code>x</code> or <code>a</code> is fine here. The
function is supposed to calculate something, not print it, so in order for this
to be useful we'll have to return the resulting value so another part of the
program can make use of it. The calculation produces an <code>int</code>, so our return
type should be <code>int</code>.</li>
</ol>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="calling-functions"><a class="header" href="#calling-functions">Calling Functions</a></h1>
<p>A <strong>function call</strong> is how we tell our program to execute the code in a
function's body. We've already written plenty of function calls: the statements
<code>println(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);</code> and <code>String name = nextLine();</code> both contain
function calls. A function call has two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A function call begins with the function's name.</li>
<li>A function call includes a list of <strong>argument</strong> in parenthesis after the
function name, or a set of empty parenthesis if the function requires no
arguments.</li>
</ul>
<p>The argument list in a function call is a list of values to use when
initializing the function's parameters. Let's consider the <code>add</code> function
defined in the previous section:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">double add(double x, double y) {
    return x + y;
}
</code></pre>
<p>We can't run the code <code>x * y</code> without first initializing <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. If we call
<code>add</code>, then we need to provide an initial value for each parameter: <code>add(2, 3)</code>.
The first argument is used to initialize the first parameter (<code>x</code>), the second
argument initializes the second parameter, and so on. You may hear the terms
&quot;argument&quot; and &quot;parameter&quot; used interchangeably because they're both referring
to a function's inputs. It's usually clear from context
what we mean when we say &quot;argument&quot; or &quot;parameter&quot;, so don't worry about getting
them mixed up. You may also see the term &quot;formal parameter&quot; used to
refer to the parameters in the function's definition and the term &quot;actual
parameter&quot; used for the values supplied with a function call.</p>
<h2 id="examples"><a class="header" href="#examples">Examples</a></h2>
<p>If we want to call the functions defined in the examples from the previous
section, we would write:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">// will print &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
sayHello();

// will print &quot;Hello Zach, how are you doing today?&quot;
greetPerson(&quot;Zach&quot;);

// will set x equal to 16
int x = square(4);

// will print 16
println(x);

// combines the previous two statements into one step; will also print 16
println(square(4));

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="arrays"><a class="header" href="#arrays">Arrays</a></h1>
<p>An array is a collection of values, all of which have the same type. They allow
you to store multiple values in the same variable, which makes it convenient to
process large amounts of information with a short loop.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="creating-arrays"><a class="header" href="#creating-arrays">Creating Arrays</a></h1>
<h2 id="declaring-an-array"><a class="header" href="#declaring-an-array">Declaring an Array</a></h2>
<p>We can have an array of ints, strings, doubles, or any of the other types we've
seen so far. We can even make arrays of arrays, but that's a topic for later.</p>
<p>An array is stored in a single variable, and unless we're using <code>var</code> to infer
the type, we need to state that it's an array and what it's an array of. We can
specify an array of some other type by adding a pair of square brackets (<code>[]</code>)
after the other type. For example, <code>int[]</code> is an array of integers, and
<code>String[]</code> is an array of strings. The following code <a href="jshell/arrays/../../variables/creating_variables.html#variable-declaration">declares</a>, but does not
<a href="jshell/arrays/../../variables/creating_variables.html#variable-initialization">initialize</a>,
several array variables of different types.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int[] arrayOfInts;
String[] arrayOfStrings;
double[] arrayOfDoubles;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="creating-a-new-array"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-new-array">Creating a new Array</a></h2>
<p>We'll usually want to initialize an array variable by creating a new array. To
create an array, we write the <code>new</code> keyword, the array's type, and the array's
size inside the square brackets. For example, <code>new int[10]</code> would create a new
array that holds ten integers. We'll modify the previous code to declare <em>and</em>
initialize our array variables:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int[] arrayOfInts = new int[10];
String[] arrayOfStrings = new String[5];
double[] arrayOfDoubles = new double[1000];
</code></pre>
<p>This has created three arrays: an array of ten integers, an array of five
strings, and an array of one-thousand doubles.</p>
<p>A couple of notes about these arrays before we continue:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each array's size is fixed once it has been created. We cannot grow or shrink
these arrays.</li>
<li>The arrays are not empty. An array always contains exactly the same number of
values. When we create new arrays like this, they are initialized with the
default value for their type: <code>0</code> for numeric types, <code>false</code> for booleans, and
<code>null</code> for strings or other objects/reference types. A value of <code>null</code> means
there is no string at that position in the array. We'll learn more about <code>null</code>
later, but for now it's enough to understand that it represents the absence of
an object.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we want to create a small array that starts with a specific set of values
instead of the default value for its type, then we have another option:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int[] countdown = new int[] { 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 };
String[] names = new String[] { &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot; };
</code></pre>
<p>This could be used for larger arrays, but it's not very practical. If our array
isn't, we'll probably want to use a loop to set the initial values after we
create the array.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="accessing-and-mutating-arrays"><a class="header" href="#accessing-and-mutating-arrays">Accessing and Mutating Arrays</a></h1>
<p>Now that you know how to create an array, what can you do with it? Let's start
by printing the array:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int[] primes = new int[] { 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 };
println(primes);
</code></pre>
<p>Was the output what you expected? Probably not. Java's default method for
converting objects into strings doesn't produce a very useful string for an
array. We can convert an array to a string with a loop, but first we need to
learn how to access the individual values in an array.</p>
<h2 id="indexing"><a class="header" href="#indexing">Indexing</a></h2>
<p>We mentioned indexing in the <a href="jshell/arrays/../../early_api/string.html">String API</a> section,
but it's worth going into more detail now that we're dealing with arrays. To
access a single value stored in an array (we call these values the array's
<strong>elements</strong>), we need to specify its index. The index of an element is that
element's distance from the beginning of the array. This means the first element
has an index of 0 because it is at the beginning of the array. The second
element has an index of 1 because it's one space away from the start of the
array.</p>
<p>If we want to refer to a specific element of an array, we put that element's
index in square brackets after the name of the array:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int[] primes = new int[] { 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 };
println(primes[0]); // prints 2
println(primes[1]); // prints 3
println(primes[2]); // prints 5
println(primes[3]); // prints 7
println(primes[4]); // prints 11
println(primes[5]); // prints 13
</code></pre>
<p>We can reassign one element of the array as long as we specify that element's
index:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int[] primes = new int[] { 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 };
primes[2] = 10;
println(primes[0]); // prints 2
println(primes[1]); // prints 3
println(primes[2]); // prints 10!
</code></pre>
<p>If you don't specify an index, you'll be attempting to reassign the variable
that holds the array. This will usually result in a syntax error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int[] primes = new int[] { 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 };
primes = 10; // primes is an array, not an int, so we can't reassign it to 10
</code></pre>
<h2 id="getting-used-to-zero-indexing"><a class="header" href="#getting-used-to-zero-indexing">Getting Used to Zero-Indexing</a></h2>
<p>Many people find zero-indexing counterintuitive. If you think of the position of
an element, then you need to subtract one from the position to get the element's
index. This isn't intuitive, and it forces you to do extra work each time you
think about the index as a position.</p>
<p>The best analogy I've heard for zero-indexing is a ruler: the first mark on a
ruler represents a distance of zero, not one. This is why I recommend thinking
about indexes as distances rather than positions.</p>
<h2 id="array-bounds"><a class="header" href="#array-bounds">Array Bounds</a></h2>
<p>You can get the length of an array by typing <code>.length</code> after the name:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int[] primes = new int[] { 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 };
println(primes.length); // prints 6
</code></pre>
<p>The only valid indexes for an array are the integers from zero to its length
minus 1. The length is never a valid index. For example, if we had an array of
length 10 then the tenth and last element would be at index 9. An index of 10
would be the eleventh element, and the array only has ten elements.</p>
<p>If we try to index an array with a negative number, or with a number greater
than or equal to its length, then this will cause an
<code>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code>, which is a type of error that will cause the
program to crash.</p>

<p>So far, arrays haven't made our lives any easier. If we always have to provide a
specific index when we interact with an array, it might as well be a bunch of
separate variables. This:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">String[] names = new String[] { &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Charles&quot; };
names[1] = &quot;Robert&quot;;
println(names[0]);
println(names[1]);
println(names[2]);
</code></pre>
<p>is no different from this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">String name1 = &quot;Alice&quot;, name2 = &quot;Bob&quot;, name3 = &quot;Charles&quot;;
name2 = &quot;Robert&quot;;
println(name1);
println(name2);
println(name3);
</code></pre>
<p>In fact, the second version is probably easier to follow. So why would we use an
array?</p>
<p>The short (and probably not very helpful) answer is because we can also index an
array using a variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">String[] names = new String[] { &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Charles&quot; };
int index = 1;
names[index] = &quot;Robert&quot;;
index = 0;
println(names[index]);
index = 1;
println(names[index]);
index = 2;
println(names[index]);
</code></pre>
<p>Acutally, that's even worse, isn't it? What if we just focus on the printing,
and we increment the index instead of assigning specific numbers?</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">String[] names = new String[] { &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Charles&quot; };
int index = 0;
println(names[index]);
index = index + 1;
println(names[index]);
index = index + 1;
println(names[index]);
</code></pre>
<p>That's not much better either. Obviously there's a point to all this, I'm not
just wasting your time. Take another look at the last version. Did you notice
two of the lines were copied and pasted several times with no changes? Isn't
there a more convenient way to repeat two lines of code over and over again?</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">String[] names = new String[] { &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Charles&quot; };
int index = 0;
while (index &lt; 3) {
    println(names[index]);
    index = index + 1;
}
</code></pre>
<p>It turns out there is! The fact that we can index with a variable lets us use a
counting loop to print each element of the array. This is even nicer if we use a
for loop:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">String[] names = new String[] { &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Charles&quot; };
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; ++i) {
    println(names[i]);
}
</code></pre>
<p>What happens if we add some more names?</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">// without an array
String name1 = &quot;Alice&quot;, name2 = &quot;Bob&quot;, name3 = &quot;Charles&quot;, name4 = &quot;David&quot;,
       name5 = &quot;Eve&quot;;
println(name1);
println(name2);
println(name3);
println(name4);
println(name5);

// with an array
String[] names = new String[] { &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Charles&quot;, &quot;David&quot;, &quot;Eve&quot; };
for (int i = 0; i &lt; names.length; ++i) {
    println(names[i]);
}
</code></pre>
<p>I changed the condition to <code>i &lt; names.length</code> instead of <code>i &lt; 5</code> because
<code>names.length</code> will always be the length of the array. Now if the array gets
larger again we won't have to change any part of the loop. Hopefully this shows
you why it's nice to have an array. Just in case you're not convinced, consider
what this would look like if we had 1000 names.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">// without an array
String name1 = &quot;Alice&quot;, name2 = &quot;Bob&quot;, /* 997 names omitted */ name1000 = &quot;asdf&quot;;
println(name1);
println(name2);
println(name3);
println(name4);
println(name5);
println(name6);
/* 993 print statements omitted */
println(name1000);

// with an array
String[] names = new String[] { &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, /* 997 names omitted */ &quot;asdf&quot; };
for (int i = 0; i &lt; names.length; ++i) {
    println(names[i]);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The loop can still print the entire array with three lines of code. This is part
of what makes arrays so powerful: when combined with a loop, you can process
vast amounts of information with several lines of code.</p>
<h2 id="enhanced-for-loop"><a class="header" href="#enhanced-for-loop">Enhanced For Loop</a></h2>
<p>Java has another type of for loop called an &quot;enhanced for loop&quot;. You might also
see this type of loop referred to as a &quot;foreach&quot; loop or a &quot;for comprehension&quot;.
An enhanced for loop is useful when you want to iterate over an array, but you
don't need to modify the array and you don't need to know the index of an
element.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">for (String name: names) {
    println(name);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>for (String name: names) {</code> is another example of syntactic sugar. The
enhanced for loop shown above is equivalent to the following regular for loop:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">for (int i = 0; i &lt; names.length; ++i) {
    String name = names[i];
    println(name);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>for (String name: names) {</code> is a shorter way of writing the first two
lines, but you no longer have access to the <code>i</code> variable inside your loop.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="reference-vs-value-types"><a class="header" href="#reference-vs-value-types">Reference vs Value Types</a></h1>
<p>Arrays and Strings are both types of objects. We can refer to them as reference
types, which differ from <a href="jshell/arrays/../../types/primitives.html">primitive types (also called value types)</a> in several ways. The primary difference is how the
program stores their data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Value-type variables directly store the data for the value they represent. If
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are value types, then the assignment statement <code>x = y</code> will copy the
data from <code>x</code> into <code>y</code>.</li>
<li>Reference-type variables store a memory address that points to their data,
which is stored in a region of memory called the <strong>heap</strong>. If <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are
reference types, then the assignment statement <code>x = y</code> will copy the memory
address from <code>x</code> into <code>y</code>, which means both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> will be pointing to the
same object.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="comparing-reference-types"><a class="header" href="#comparing-reference-types">Comparing Reference Types</a></h2>
<p>When you compare two variables using <code>==</code> or <code>!=</code>, the program checks whether
the data stored in the variables is identical. This works fine for value types,
which directly store a representation of their value. This will not work for
reference types, because the data in the variable is a memory address and not a
representation of the data those variables represent.</p>
<p>If <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are reference types, then this means <code>x == y</code> will ask whether
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code> point to the same location in memory, not whether they point to
identical data. If you have two different but identical objects stored in <code>x</code>
and <code>y</code>, then <code>x == y</code> will evaluate to <code>false</code>. Try running the code below to
see this in action:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int[] a = new int[] { 1, 2, 3 };
int[] b = new int[] { 1. 2, 3 };
int[] c = a;

if (a == b) {
    println(&quot;a equals b&quot;);
} else {
    println(&quot;a doesn't equal b&quot;);
}

if (b == c) {
    println(&quot;b equals c&quot;);
} else {
    println(&quot;b doesn't equal c&quot;);
}

if (a == c) {
    println(&quot;a equals c&quot;);
} else {
    println(&quot;a doesn't equal c&quot;);
}

String x = new String(&quot;Hello&quot;);
String y = new String(&quot;Hello&quot;);
String z = y;

if (x == y) {
    println(&quot;x equals y&quot;);
} else {
    println(&quot;x doesn't equal y&quot;);
}

if (y == z) {
    println(&quot;y equals z&quot;);
} else {
    println(&quot;y doesn't equal z&quot;);
}

if (x == z) {
    println(&quot;x equals z&quot;);
} else {
    println(&quot;x doesn't equal z&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Some reference types define an <code>equals</code> method to compare their data instead of
their memory addresses. The <code>String</code> type does this, so we can use <code>x.equals(y)</code>
to ask whether the contents of two strings <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are equal. If <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
are strings, then <code>x.equals(y)</code> behaves the same as <code>a == b</code> would behave if <code>a</code>
and <code>b</code> were value types.</p>
<p>Other reference types, such as arrays, do not define their own version of the
<code>equals</code> method. These reference types still have the <code>equals</code> method, but it
won't be any more helpful than <code>==</code>. If we want to compare two arrays, then we
need to write our own code to check each element of the arrays and determine
whether they're equal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">boolean areEqual(int[] a, int[] b) {
    // If the lengths differ, then we know they're different. It also wouldn't
    // be safe to iterate over both with one loop, so it's important to return
    // before we get to the for loop.
    if (a.length != b.length) {
        return false;
    }

    // If the lengths are the same (and we'll return earlier if they aren't),
    // then we can use a loop to compare the elements at each index of the
    // arrays.
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; a.length; ++i) {
        // If two elements at the same index don't match, then the arrays aren't
        // equal
        if (a[i] != b[i]) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    // If we don't find any pairs of unequal elements, then we know the arrays
    // have the same length and contain the same elements. Sounds like they're
    // equal!
    return true;
}

int[] a = new int[] { 1, 2, 3 };

<h2 id="immutable-data"><a class="header" href="#immutable-data">Immutable Data</a></h2>
<p>The <code>String</code> type is <strong>immutable</strong>, which means that we can't modify (or mutate)
the data inside of a string after we create the string. However, we can create
new strings based on an existing string, which is what happens when we
concatenate strings or call one of the string methods (such as <code>toLowerCase</code>).
The following code demonstrates that the original string <code>a</code> won't change when
we concatenate it with other strings and call various methods on it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">String a = &quot;Hello&quot;;

// Show the value of a
println(&quot;a: &quot; + a);

// Create new strings using a
String b = a + &quot; World&quot;;

String d = a.replace(&quot;ello&quot;, &quot;i&quot;);

// Show the value of a again (hasn't changed)

// Show the value of the variables we created using a
println(&quot;b: &quot; + b);
println(&quot;c: &quot; + c);
println(&quot;d: &quot; + d);
</code></pre>
<p>If we reassign a variable containing a reference to immutable data, then the
original data still exists. Just because the string <code>a</code> points to is immutable,
this doesn't mean the memory address stored in <code>a</code> can't be changed to point to
different data.</p>

they will both reflect this change.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="jshell-to-compiled-java"><a class="header" href="#jshell-to-compiled-java">Jshell to Compiled Java</a></h1>
<p>This chapter covers the major changes you'll encounter when switching from
jshell scripts to compiled Java programs. We started off using jshell because
it simplified a few things (shorter I/O commands, no need to worry about the
mysterious Java program structure), but at this point jshell is limiting us
more than helping us.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="java-program-structure"><a class="header" href="#java-program-structure">Java Program Structure</a></h1>
<p>Java programs have to follow a specific structure. For now, we're just going to
look at programs that fit into a single <code>.java</code> file, but later we'll see longer
programs that span two or more files.</p>
<p>We'll be using the hello world program below as an example to explain the
structure of a Java program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">// The body of the HelloWorld class contains our program
// - the class keyword is new
// - HelloWorld is an identifier (the class's name)
class HelloWorld
{
    // The main method (a function attached to the HelloWorld class) is the
    // entry point for our program
    //
    // There aren't many new concepts here:
    // - the public and static keywords
    //
    // We've seen everything else before
    // - the void keyword tells us that the main method returns nothing
    // - main is an identifier (the method's name)
    // - the parenthesis after main contain the method's parameter list
    // - the String[] type is an array of strings
    // - args is an identifier (the parameter's name)
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // This print statement prints the string &quot;Hello World&quot; to standard out
        // - System.out is new
        // - we've been using the println method since the quickstart chapter
        System.out.println(&quot;Hello World&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="classes"><a class="header" href="#classes">Classes</a></h2>
<p>The first new concept we have to cover is a <strong>class</strong>. We're not going to fully
explore classes right away, so we'll start with a simplified definition for a
class: a class is a container for our program and its methods (functions). This
is an incomplete and misleading definition, but it's good enough for now.</p>
<p>There are a few other things you should know about classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A class will usually start with the <code>public</code> keyword (<code>public class ClassName</code>
instead of <code>class ClassName</code>). You're likely to see this in other examples, but
for now it's unnecessary.</li>
<li>A class's name follows the usual rules for an identifier, but unlike variable
and function names, class names should always start with a capital letter.</li>
<li>The class's name must match the filename. The hello world example must be in a
file named <code>HelloWorld.java</code>, with the same exact capitalization.</li>
<li>The body of our class goes in a code block after the class name. This will
include <em>all</em> of the code in our program for now.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-entry-point"><a class="header" href="#the-entry-point">The Entry Point</a></h2>
<p>A Java program can consist of many classes, and each class can contain many
methods. Most of the code in a class (for now, <em>all</em> of the code) has to be
inside of the class's methods. However, if we compile and run our program, it
needs to know which method to call when the program starts. This is the
program's entry point, and it's always going to be a method with the name
<code>main</code> and an array of strings as its only parameter.</p>
<p>With a few changes, most of your jshell scripts can be converted into Java
programs by placing all of their code into a class's main method.</p>
<h3 id="program-arguments"><a class="header" href="#program-arguments">Program Arguments</a></h3>
<p>When you enter a command on the terminal, you can include one or more arguments
after the name of the command. For example, the <code>cd</code> command is usually followed
by an argument to specify which directory you want to move to. This is very
similar to how a function call in Java can accept arguments.</p>
<p>When you run a Java program, you can include arguments for the program on the
terminal. These arguments will be parsed as strings and placed in your <code>main</code>
method's <code>args</code> parameter.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="compile-and-run"><a class="header" href="#compile-and-run">Compile and Run</a></h1>
<p>There are two steps to running a Java program on the terminal:</p>
<ol>
<li>Compile the program if you made any changes to the code since the last time
you compiled it. This uses the command <code>javac Filename</code>.</li>
<li>Run the compiled program with the command <code>java ClassName</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>For practice, try using the following commands to compile and run the hello
world program from the previous section: <code>javac HelloWorld.java</code>, then
<code>java HelloWorld</code>.</p>
<p>A few notes about compiling and running Java programs this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to be in the folder containing the source code (the <code>.java</code>
file(s)).</li>
<li>The <code>javac</code> command uses the program's file name, which ends in <code>.java</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>javac</code> command will generate a <code>.class</code> file for each <code>.java</code> file it
compiles. These <code>.class</code> files are your compiled program.</li>
<li>The <code>java</code> command uses the class name, which <strong>does not</strong> end in <code>.java</code>.</li>
<li>You can include additional arguments after the class name when using the
<code>java</code> command. These arguments will end up in your <code>main</code> method's <code>args</code>
parameter.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="example-of-program-arguments"><a class="header" href="#example-of-program-arguments">Example of Program Arguments</a></h2>
<p>Try running the following program with different sets of command line arguments:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">class ArgsProgram
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println(&quot;Printing all program args:&quot;);
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; args.length; ++i)
        {
            System.out.printf(&quot;\targs[%d] = %s\n&quot;, i, args[i]);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Try using each of the commands below (don't include the <code>$</code>, it just marks the
start of a terminal prompt) and predicting what the output will be before you
run the command. Are any of the results surprising? What can you learn about
command line arguments from the results?</p>
<pre><code>$ java ArgsProgram a b c
$ java ArgsProgram a,b,c
$ java ArgsProgram a, b, c
$ java ArgsProgram &quot;a b c&quot;
$ java ArgsProgram a\ b c
$ java ArgsProgram Hello, World
$ java ArgsProgram &quot;Hello, World&quot;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="compiler-errors-and-runtime-errors"><a class="header" href="#compiler-errors-and-runtime-errors">Compiler Errors and Runtime Errors</a></h2>
<p>Our jshell scripts were <strong>interpreted</strong> by the jshell program. This means it
looked at one line or code block at a time and tried to run that piece of code
before looking at the next piece. If we typed some invalid code, then we would
see an error when it tried to run that code and it would continue trying to run
the rest of our script.</p>
<p>A Java program is <strong>compiled</strong>. This means the compiler checks the code to make
sure it follows Java's syntax rules, then it converts the code into Java
<strong>bytecode</strong>, which can be executed by the <strong>Java Virtual Machine</strong>. Certain
types of errors will prevent our code from compiling, which means we can't even
try to run the program. These are called <strong>compiler errors</strong> or <strong>syntax
errors</strong>. If our code doesn't follow Java's syntax (grammar) rules, then it
isn't valid Java code and will be rejected by the compiler.</p>
<p>Syntax errors can be annoying, especially as a beginner who makes this type of
error frequently. However, these is the best kind of error to have in your
program. A syntax error will be caught immediately when you compile your
program, and some editors will warn you about syntax errors as you are editing
your code, before you even try to compile. Your editor or compiler can tell you
exactly where the syntax error is located, and the error message will often be
helpful when you try to figure out the problem.</p>
<p>Runtime errors, on the other hand, cannot be caught by the compiler. A runtime
error occurs while your program is running when the program tries to do
something that it isn't allowed to do (such as index an array with a negative
number or divide an integer by zero). A runtime error will immediately crash
your program and show an error message. This type of error can be harder to
diagnose, because it may only happen with certain inputs, and you won't get a
warning from your editor or compiler about it. You'll usually have to spend a
little bit of time investigating a runtime error before you'll know how to fix
it.</p>
<h3 id="semantic-errors"><a class="header" href="#semantic-errors">Semantic Errors</a></h3>
<p>It's also worth mentioning a third type of error, called a <strong>logic error</strong> or a
<strong>semantic error</strong>. This type of error is usually the most difficult to fix,
because it often won't crash your program and provide an error message to show
you what went wrong. A logic error occurs when you make a mistake in your
program's logic that causes it to run but produce incorrect output or otherwise
behave incorrectly. Sometimes this can lead to an infinite loop, or maybe your
program will print the wrong answer to a question five percent of the time. You
can catch logic errors by manually testing your program or by writing automated
tests, like the test scripts included with some of the projects.</p>

<h2 id="output-1"><a class="header" href="#output-1">Output</a></h2>
<p>The <code>PRINTING</code> script we added to our jshell startup created shorter print
functions for our jshell scripts to use. This is why we could type <code>println</code>
instead of <code>System.out.println</code>. In a Java program, we need to specify an output
stream when we want to print something. <code>System.out</code> is an output stream
connected to standard out, and <code>System.err</code> is an output stream connected to
standard err (which is used for printing error messages). All of the print
functions we used in jshell still work in Java as long as you begin them with
<code>System.out.</code>.</p>
<h2 id="input-1"><a class="header" href="#input-1">Input</a></h2>
<p>The <code>INPUT.jsh</code> script we added to our jshell startup created a <code>Scanner</code> and
some shorter input functions (<code>nextInt</code>, <code>nextLine</code>, etc.) for our jshell
scripts to use. To do the same thing in a Java program, we need to create a
scanner connected to an input stream (<code>System.in</code> is what we'll normally use),
then we can call that scanner's input methods. The same input functions will
work as long as we call them as methods on our <code>System.in</code> scanner.</p>
<p>We also need to import the scanner class before we can use it in our program. An
<code>import</code> statement normally goes at the beginning of our program, before the
start of our class. See the code below for a complete example of creating and
using a <code>System.in</code> scanner.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">// Import the scanner at the beginning of the file
import java.util.Scanner;

// Remember to name this file InputExample.java so it can compile
class InputExample
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Create a new scanner to read from the System.in input stream
        // NOTE: We should only create the System.in scanner once in our entire
        // program! We should only have one scanner reading from a particular
        // input stream.
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        // The usual prompt for input pattern, but with a scanner!
        System.out.println(&quot;Please enter your first name.&quot;);
        String firstName = input.nextLine();

        System.out.println(&quot;Please enter your last name.&quot;);
        String lastName = input.nextLine();

        // Don't forget we have printf as well as println
        System.out.printf(&quot;Your full name is %s %s.\n&quot;, firstName, lastName);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="functions-3"><a class="header" href="#functions-3">Functions</a></h2>
<p>Functions have to be formatted slightly differently in a Java program compared
to a jshell script. They're also referred to as methods (although the term
function is still accurate, just less specific). All of our functions will need
to include the <code>static</code> keyword before their return type (just like main). This
marks them as a standalone function that can be called from the class. When we
learn how to instantiate our classes later on, we'll be able to write non-static
methods.</p>
<p>We also cannot define methods inside of other methods. Jshell didn't allow this
either, but if you copy a jshell script into your <code>main</code> method, then you'll end
up with all of your functions defined inside of the <code>main</code> method.</p>
<p>Finally, we don't have to worry about the order of our method definitions in a
Java program! You can define all of your other methods after the main method,
and Java won't have a problem with this.</p>
<h2 id="semicolons-2"><a class="header" href="#semicolons-2">Semicolons</a></h2>
<p>Jshell did not require semicolons at the end of statements outside of code
blocks. In Java, statements typically need to end with a semicolon. There are
some lines of code where we should never use semicolons, and we've covered many
of these before. However, let's go over them all again right here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never put a semicolon at the end of an <code>if</code> statement, <code>while</code> loop, or <code>for</code>
loop. The chapters about if statements and loops goes into more detail about
why.
<ul>
<li>One small exception is the do-while loop: you must put a semicolon at the
end of the <code>while</code> line in a do-while loop, but you should <strong>never</strong> do this
to a regular while loop!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Never put a semicolon at the end of a function signature or class declaration.</li>
<li>We rarely need to put semicolons after curly braces, at least not when they're
marking a code block.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the code examples in this book will show examples of where to use
semicolons and where not to use them. You're probably somewhat used to this
already from writing code in code blocks for jshell scripts. The only difference
when switching to Java programs is that they're no longer optional in the main
body of your program.</p>
<h2 id="code-blocks"><a class="header" href="#code-blocks">Code Blocks</a></h2>
<p>One other small change is the structure of code blocks. Jshell's interpreter
doesn't allow you to write the opening brace for the body of an if statement or
a loop on the line after the if statement or loop. A Java program has no problem
with this, as you can see in the example programs. It doesn't matter which style
you use when writing code blocks, but you should always be consistent. Don't
switch styles in the middle of a program.</p>

because that part isn't relevant to the pattern), it will be replaced with an
